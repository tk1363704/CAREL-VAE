 (2, 2),
1,6,-1,That day Jobs walked into the lobby of the video game manufacturer Atari and told the personnel director
2,3,-1,who was startled by his unkempt hair and attire
3,6,-1,that he would n't leave until they gave him a job .
2 4
 (4, 4),
1,6,-1,Jobs spent a few days in Munich
2,6,-1,where he solved the interference problem
3,6,-1,but in the process he flummoxed the dark suited German managers
4,2,-1,They complained to Alcorn that he dressed and smelled like a bum and behaved rudely .
3 2
 (2, 2),
1,6,-1,For his part
2,4,-1,Jobs was upset that the Germans kept trying to feed him meat and potatoes .
8 4
 (1, 1),
1,0,-1,Wozniak was thrilled when Jobs asked him to help and proposed splitting the fee
2,6,-1,this was the most wonderful offer in my life
3,6,-1,to actually design a game that people would use
4,6,-1,he recalled .
9 4
 (2, 2),
1,6,-1,The Atari experience helped shape Jobs 's approach to business and design
2,0,-1,He appreciated the user friendliness of Atari 's insert quarter avoid klingons games
3,6,-1,that simplicity rubbed off on him and made him a very focused product person
4,6,-1,said Ron Wayne .
10 6
 (1, 2),
1,3,-1,I typed a few keys on the keyboard and I was shocked
2,6,-1,The letters were displayed on the screen
3,6,-1,t was Sunday
4,6,-1,June 29
5,6,-1,1975
6,6,-1,a milestone for the personal computer .
11 4
 (3, 2),
1,6,-1,His argument was that a great engineer would be remembered only if he teamed with a great marketer
2,6,-1,and this required him to commit his designs to the partnership
3,0,-1,Jobs was so impressed and grateful that he offered Wayne a 10% stake in the new partnership
4,6,-1,turning him into a tie-breaker if Jobs and Wozniak disagreed over an issue .
12 4
 (3, 2),
1,6,-1,His argument was that a great engineer would be remembered only if he teamed with a great marketer
2,6,-1,and this required him to commit his designs to the partnership
3,0,-1,Jobs was so impressed and grateful that he offered Wayne a 10% stake in the new partnership
4,6,-1,turning him into a tie-breaker if Jobs and Wozniak disagreed over an issue .
13 2
 (2, 2),
1,6,-1,Jobs and Wozniak had no personal assets
2,4,-1,but Wayne ( who worried about a global financial Armageddon ) kept gold coins hidden in his mattress .
14 5
 (5, 5),
1,6,-1,Jobs and Wozniak had no personal assets
2,6,-1,but Wayne ( who worried about a global financial Armageddon ) kept gold coins hidden in his mattress
3,6,-1,Because they had structured Apple as a simple partnership rather than a corporation
4,6,-1,the partners would be personally liable for the debts
5,4,-1,and Wayne was afraid potential creditors would go after him .
17 8
 (1, 6),
1,3,-1,Terrell was a bit taken aback
2,6,-1,There was no power supply
3,6,-1,case
4,6,-1,monitor
5,6,-1,or keyboard
6,6,-1,He had expected something more finished
7,6,-1,But Jobs stared him down
8,6,-1,and he agreed to take delivery and pay .
18 4
 (1, 4),
1,0,-1,As Wozniak later exulted
2,6,-1,We were participating in the biggest revolution that had ever happened
3,6,-1,I thought
4,6,-1,I was so happy to be a part of it .
19 5
 (3, 1),
1,6,-1,You might want to buy us for a few hundred thousand dollars
2,6,-1,Jobs said when they got there
3,3,-1,Wozniak was stunned by this ridiculous
4,6,-1,suggestion
5,6,-1,but Jobs persisted .
20 2
 (2, 1),
1,6,-1,Within weeks he had produced a simple foam molded plastic case that was uncluttered and exuded friendliness
2,0,-1,Jobs was thrilled .
21 1
 (1, 1),
1,2,-1,What bothered him more was that Jobs knew nothing about marketing and seemed content to peddle his product to individual stores one by one .
22 3
 (2, 1),
1,6,-1,He wanted to secure a location right at the front of the hall as a dramatic way to launch the Apple II
2,3,-1,and so he shocked Wozniak by paying $5
3,6,-1,000 in advance .
23 2
 (2, 2),
1,6,-1,Like Markkula
2,2,-1,he hated dealing with the conflicts that Jobs engendered .
24 8
 (7, 1),
1,6,-1,Scott assigned  1 to Wozniak and  2 to Jobs
2,6,-1,Not surprisingly
3,6,-1,Jobs demanded to be  1
4,6,-1,I would n't let him have it
5,6,-1,because that would stoke his ego even more
6,6,-1,said Scott
7,5,-1,Jobs threw a tantrum
8,6,-1,even cried .
25 8
 (8, 1),
1,6,-1,Scott assigned  1 to Wozniak and  2 to Jobs
2,6,-1,Not surprisingly
3,6,-1,Jobs demanded to be  1
4,6,-1,I would n't let him have it
5,6,-1,because that would stoke his ego even more
6,6,-1,said Scott
7,6,-1,Jobs threw a tantrum
8,1,-1,even cried .
26 3
 (3, 2),
1,6,-1,Jobs also insisted that Apple be different in how it treated customers
2,6,-1,He wanted a one year warranty to come with the Apple II
3,3,-1,This flabbergasted Scott
27 4
 (3, 2),
1,6,-1,A year after Lisa was born
2,6,-1,Jobs agreed to take a paternity test
3,3,-1,Brennan 's family was surprised
4,6,-1,but Jobs knew that Apple would soon be going public and he decided it was best to get the issue resolved .
29 4
 (3, 2),(3, 4),
1,6,-1,Atkinson and others had read some of the papers published by Xerox PARC
2,6,-1,so they knew they were not getting a full description
3,2,-1,Jobs phoned the head of the Xerox venture capital division to complain
4,6,-1,a call immediately came back from corporate headquarters in Connecticut decreeing that Jobs and his group should be shown everything .
30 5
 (4, 1),
1,6,-1,They said it would force us to use a phosphor that was a lot less persistent and would flicker more
2,6,-1,o Atkinson enlisted Jobs
3,6,-1,who came down on his side
4,2,-1,The hardware folks grumbled
5,6,-1,but then went off and figured it out .
31 6
 (5, 3),
1,6,-1,He was working so hard that one morning
2,6,-1,in a daze
3,6,-1,he drove his Corvette into a parked truck and nearly killed himself
4,6,-1,Jobs immediately drove to the hospital to see him
5,4,-1,We were pretty worried about you
6,6,-1,he said when Atkinson regained consciousness .
32 4
 (3, 1),(3, 2),
1,6,-1,This required using a ball rather than the usual two wheels
2,6,-1,One of the engineers told Atkinson that there was no way to build such a mouse commercially
3,2,-1,After Atkinson complained to Jobs over dinner
4,6,-1,he arrived at the office the next day to discover that Jobs had fired the engineer .
33 3
 (3, 3),
1,6,-1,But John Couch and the other professional engineers on his Lisa team
2,6,-1,many of them buttoned down HP types
3,5,-1,resented Jobs 's meddling and were infuriated by his frequent insults .
34 3
 (1, 1),
1,4,-1,Both Mike Scott and Mike Markkula were intent on bringing some order to Apple and became increasingly concerned about Jobs 's disruptive behavior
2,6,-1,So in September 1980
3,6,-1,they secretly plotted a reorganization .
35 6
 (5, 1),
1,6,-1,He was made non-executive chairman of the board
2,6,-1,This position allowed him to remain Apple 's public face
3,6,-1,but it meant that he had no operating control
4,6,-1,That hurt
5,4,-1,I was upset and felt abandoned by Markkula
6,6,-1,he said .
38 2
 (2, 1),
1,6,-1,Some of the people on the project became enamored of the quest to do everything with the mouse
2,2,-1,he later grouse .
39 6
 (2, 2),
1,6,-1,Jobs even tried to reengage Wozniak
2,2,-1,I resented the fact that he had not been doing much
3,6,-1,but then I thought
4,6,-1,hell
5,6,-1,I would n't be here without his brilliance
6,6,-1,Jobs later told me .
41 3
 (3, 3),
1,6,-1,One day Jobs came into the cubicle of Larry Kenyon
2,6,-1,an engineer who was working on the Macintosh operating system
3,2,-1,and complained that it was taking too long to boot up .
43 3
 (1, 2),
1,2,-1,Then Jobs let loose a blistering burst of criticism
2,6,-1,It 's way too boxy
3,6,-1,it 's got to be more curvaceous .
44 9
 (9, 1),(9, 4),
1,6,-1,He had just come up with a brilliant algorithm that could draw circles and ovals onscreen quickly
2,6,-1,The math for making circles usually required calculating square roots
3,6,-1,which the 68000 microprocessor didnt support
4,6,-1,But Atkinson did a workaround based on the fact that the sum of a sequence of odd numbers produces a sequence of perfect squares ( for example
5,6,-1,1 + 3 = 4
6,6,-1,1 + 3 + 5 = 9
7,6,-1,etc
8,6,-1,Hertzfeld recalled that when Atkinson fired up his demo
9,3,-1,everyone was impressed except Jobs .
46 3
 (3, 1),
1,6,-1,Jobs wants to destroy Lisa because we would n't let him control it
2,6,-1,he said
3,1,-1,looking as if he were about to cry .
47 5
 (5, 2),
1,6,-1,Atkinson had been left out of the publicity interviews for the Lisa launch
2,6,-1,and he marched into Jobs 's hotel room and threatened to quit
3,6,-1,Jobs tried to minimize the slight
4,6,-1,but Atkinson refused to be mollified
5,5,-1,Jobs got annoyed .
48 8
 (7, 2),
1,6,-1,But by the time the Lisa was ready to ship in the spring of 1983
2,6,-1,it was clear that the Twiggy was buggy
3,6,-1,Because the Lisa also came with a hard-disk drive
4,6,-1,this was not a complete disaster
5,6,-1,But the Mac had no hard disk
6,6,-1,so it faced a crisis
7,4,-1,The Mac team was beginning to panic
8,6,-1,said Hertzfeld .
49 5
 (3, 2),(5, 2),
1,6,-1,A few days later he drove to Apple 's factory in San Jose to see the Twiggy being made
2,6,-1,More than half were rejected
3,5,-1,Jobs erupted
4,6,-1,With his face flushed
5,5,-1,he began shouting and sputtering about firing everyone who worked there .
50 2
 (2, 2),
1,6,-1,He took them to visit a computer store
2,3,-1,where he was struck by how poorly the products were marketed .
51 2
 (2, 2),
1,6,-1,When he arrived at Apple headquarters
2,3,-1,Sculley was startled by the unassuming offices and casual atmosphere .
52 5
 (4, 3),
1,6,-1,The explanation that Sculley might buy a lot of Macintoshes for Pepsi sounded a little bit fishy to me
2,6,-1,Hertzfeld recalled
3,6,-1,but he and Susan Kare created a screen of Pepsi caps and cans that danced around with the Apple logo
4,0,-1,Hertzfeld was so excited he began waving his arms around during the demo
5,6,-1,but Sculley seemed underwhelmed .
53 5
 (4, 3),
1,6,-1,The explanation that Sculley might buy a lot of Macintoshes for Pepsi sounded a little bit fishy to me
2,6,-1,Hertzfeld recalled
3,6,-1,but he and Susan Kare created a screen of Pepsi caps and cans that danced around with the Apple logo
4,0,-1,Hertzfeld was so excited he began waving his arms around during the demo
5,6,-1,but Sculley seemed underwhelmed .
54 2
 (1, 2),
1,3,-1,Sculley was astonished
2,6,-1,At Pepsi no one would have challenged the chairman like that .
55 3
 (3, 2),
1,6,-1,To him
2,6,-1,the marketing costs were like any other production cost and needed to be factored into the price
3,5,-1,Jobs resisted furiously .
56 6
 (6, 6),
1,6,-1,So Jobs promised them
2,6,-1,dont worry
3,6,-1,im not going to let him get away with it
4,6,-1,But in the end
5,6,-1,Sculley prevailed
6,5,-1,Even twenty-five years later Jobs seethed when recalling the decision :  It 's the main reason the Macintosh sales slowed and Microsoft got to dominate the market .
57 5
 (2, 2),
1,6,-1,Hertzfeld
2,0,-1,who took great pride that they could achieve their functionality solely using software
3,6,-1,replied
4,6,-1,We dont have any special hardware for it
5,6,-1,Gates insisted that it was necessary to have special hardware to move the cursor that way .
58 3
 (2, 2),
1,6,-1,Despite their mutual wariness
2,0,-1,both teams were excited by the prospect that Microsoft would create graphical software for the Macintosh that would take personal computing into a new realm
3,6,-1,and they went to dinner at a fancy restaurant to celebrate .
59 5
 (1, 4),(1, 5),
1,0,-1,But this arrangement upset competing software makers
2,6,-1,In addition
3,6,-1,it seemed that some of Microsoft 's programs might be late
4,6,-1,So Jobs invoked a provision in his deal with Microsoft and decided not to bundle its software
5,6,-1,Microsoft would have to scramble to distribute its software as products sold directly to consumers .
60 2
 (2, 2),
1,6,-1,As Jobs and his team began to work closely with Microsoft
2,4,-1,they grew worried that it would copy Macintosh 's graphical user interface .
61 2
 (2, 1),
1,6,-1,I drew a circle
2,0,-1,Warhol exclaimed proudly after using QuickDraw .
62 5
 (3, 2),
1,6,-1,After Jobs talked about the just-in-time production schedules
2,6,-1,she asked about overtime pay
3,5,-1,He was annoyed
4,6,-1,so he described how automation helped him keep down labor costs
5,6,-1,a subject he knew would not delight her .
64 7
 (6, 5),
1,6,-1,He was just completely obnoxious and thinking he could get away with anything
2,6,-1,she recalled
3,6,-1,In Paris she had arranged a formal dinner with French software developers
4,6,-1,but Jobs suddenly decided he didnt want to go
5,6,-1,Instead he shut the car door on Hoffman and told her he was going to see the poster artist Folon instead
6,5,-1,The developers were so pissed off they would n't shake our hands
7,6,-1,she said .
65 2
 (2, 1),
1,6,-1,When Jobs made his usual threat about cutting down on France 's allocations if Gass  e didnt jack up sales projections
2,5,-1,Gass  e got angry .
66 3
 (1, 1),
1,5,-1,I was furious because the Mac XL wasnt real
2,6,-1,said Hoffman
3,6,-1,It was just to blow the excess Lisas out the door .
68 8
 (8, 3),
1,6,-1,The Macintosh team is doing great
2,6,-1,and im having the best time of my life right now
3,6,-1,you 're just completely out of touch
4,6,-1,is stare was withering
5,6,-1,but he also tried to look amused at Hertzfeld 's assessment
6,6,-1,you really believe that
7,6,-1,I dont think there 's any way that I can come back
8,1,-1,Hertzfeld replied glumly .
69 2
 (2, 2),
1,6,-1,By early 1985 Burrell Smith was also ready to leave
2,4,-1,He had worried that it would be hard to quit if Jobs tried to talk him out of it
70 2
 (2, 1),
1,6,-1,There he happened to see sketches that the firm had made for Wozniak 's new remote control device
2,5,-1,and he flew into a rage .
71 1
 (1, 1),
1,5,-1,As the Macintosh continued to disappoint - sales in March 1985 were only 10% of the budget forecast  .  Jobs holed up in his office fuming or wandered the halls berating everyone else for the problems .
72 2
 (1, 2),
1,5,-1,In his growling voice
2,6,-1,he said that Jobs had been behaving foolishly for a year and had no right to be managing a division .
74 2
 (1, 1),
1,5,-1,His ire stoked by hearing from Markkula that Jobs had spent the previous evening trying to subvert him
2,6,-1,Sculley walked over to Jobs 's office on Tuesday morning .
76 2
 (2, 1),
1,6,-1,He warned them that there were strict laws against sharing technology with the Soviets
2,5,-1,Jobs was annoyed .
77 2
 (2, 2),
1,6,-1,Lewin 's university consortium had been a godsend to the Macintosh group
2,1,-1,but he had become frustrated after Jobs left and Bill Campbell had reorganized marketing in a way that reduced the role of direct sales to universities .
79 1
 (1, 1),
1,3,-1,What particularly struck Nocera was Jobs 's almost willful lack of tact .
80 3
 (3, 1),
1,6,-1,In the spring of 1988 cash was running so short that he convened a meeting to decree deep spending cuts across the board
2,6,-1,When it was over
3,4,-1,Lasseter and his animation group were almost too afraid to ask Jobs about authorizing some extra money for another short .
81 6
 (6, 3),
1,6,-1,Jobs had been reluctant to let Paul and Clara
2,6,-1,whom he considered his real parents
3,6,-1,know about his search for his birth mother
4,6,-1,With a sensitivity that was unusual for him
5,6,-1,and which showed the deep affection he felt for his parents
6,5,-1,he worried that they might be offended .
83 1
 (1, 1),
1,0,-1,Jobs was thrilled to find that he had a sibling who was so similar to him .
86 6
 (2, 2),
1,6,-1,On occasion this could backfire
2,4,-1,such as when Jobs and Ive insisted on using a solid piece of brushed aluminum for the edge of the iPhone 4 even when the engineers worried that it would compromise the antenna
3,6,-1,But usually the distinctiveness of its designs for the iMac
4,6,-1,the iPod
5,6,-1,the iPhone
6,6,-1,and the iPad would set Apple apart and lead to its triumphs in the years after Jobs returned .
94 6
 (6, 4),
1,6,-1,So Woolard happily granted Jobs 's wish
2,6,-1,with a Gulfstream V
3,6,-1,and also offered him fourteen million stock options
4,6,-1,Jobs gave an unexpected response
5,6,-1,He wanted more :  twenty million options
6,4,-1,Woolard was baffled and upset .
96 3
 (2, 1),
1,6,-1,The most Zen of all simplicities was Jobs 's decree
2,3,-1,which astonished his colleagues
3,6,-1,that the iPod would not have an on-off switch .
99 9
 (9, 8),
1,6,-1,But as soon as they checked in
2,6,-1,he braced himself
3,6,-1,and sure enough his phone rang a minute later
4,6,-1,I hate my room
5,6,-1,Jobs declared
6,6,-1,It 's a piece of shit
7,6,-1,let 's go
8,6,-1,So Ive gathered his luggage and went to the front desk
9,3,-1,where Jobs bluntly told the shocked clerk what he thought .
100 7
 (2, 2),
1,6,-1,Bewkes didnt agree with any of those premises
2,0,-1,He said he was happy for Apple to sell digital subscriptions for Time Inc
3,6,-1,Apple 's 30% take was not the problem
4,6,-1,im telling you right now
5,6,-1,if you sell a sub for us
6,6,-1,you can have 30%
7,6,-1,Bewkes told him .
102 4
 (2, 1),
1,6,-1,What did he think of the suggestion that Apple sometimes acted arrogantly
2,4,-1,im not worried about that
3,6,-1,he said
4,6,-1,because we 're not arrogant .
718 6
 (4, 2),
1,6,-1,Jobs stood back and proudly gazed at his new Macintosh
2,6,-1,It looks like it 's from another planet
3,6,-1,he said
4,0,-1,as the audience laughed
5,6,-1,a good planet
6,6,-1,A planet with better designers .
719 7
 (2, 4),
1,6,-1,He perked up when the reporter said something like
2,0,-1,dont get excited
3,6,-1,Mac users
4,6,-1,because it wont work with Macs
5,6,-1,ncaid said to himself
6,6,-1,Ha
7,6,-1,I can fix that
721 1
 (1, 1),
1,4,-1,He was worried that the era of promoting a song through airplay on the radio was over .
722 3
 (2, 2),
1,6,-1,We dont want to do this for anyone else
2,4,-1,e was worried about setting the precedent of artists getting a royalty from each iPod sold
3,6,-1,Vincent assured him that the U2 deal would be special .
723 3
 (1, 3),
1,4,-1,Lasseter began to get worried when
2,6,-1,in early 1996
3,6,-1,he heard rumors that DreamWorks might be making its own computer-animated movie about ants .
726 4
 (4, 3),
1,6,-1,Jony and Steve were riffing on their design problem
2,6,-1,then Jony asked
3,6,-1,what if the screen was separated from the base like a sunflower
4,0,-1,He got excited and started sketching .
727 5
 (1, 3),
1,4,-1,The problem was that he worried about his image
2,6,-1,especially after the Fortune article
3,6,-1,He did not want to accept the new grant unless the board canceled his old options at the same time
4,6,-1,But to do so would have adverse accounting implications
5,6,-1,because it would be effectively repricing the old options .
728 4
 (3, 3),
1,6,-1,He 's a one-of-a-kind person  a genius
2,6,-1,ubinstein 's case was a little more contentious
3,4,-1,He was upset by Cook 's ascendency and frazzled after working for nine years under Jobs
4,6,-1,Their shouting matches became more frequent .
729 4
 (2, 2),
1,6,-1,Because most of his colleagues were used to it by then and had learned to cope
2,4,-1,what upset them most was when his ire turned on strangers
3,6,-1,Once we went to a Whole Foods market to get a smoothie
4,6,-1,Ive recalled .
730 6
 (4, 4),
1,6,-1,Jobs would get bored
2,6,-1,grab Riley 's mobile phone
3,6,-1,and start pointing out all the ways it was brain-dead
4,0,-1,o Jobs and his team became excited  about the prospect of building a phone that they would want to use
5,6,-1,That 's the best motivator of all
6,6,-1,Jobs later said .
731 3
 (1, 1),
1,5,-1,Gates was annoyed that the guy kept revealing information about the tablet PC he had developed for Microsoft
2,6,-1,He 's our employee and he 's revealing our intellectual property
3,6,-1,Gates recounted .
732 3
 (3, 3),
1,6,-1,A lot of features that seem simple now were the result of creative brainstorms
2,6,-1,For example
3,4,-1,the team worried about how to prevent the device from playing music or making a call accidentally when it was jangling in your pocket .
733 6
 (6, 4),
1,6,-1,He continued to insist that the Microsoft approach of using a stylus for input would prevail
2,6,-1,i 've been predicting a tablet with a stylus for many years
3,6,-1,he told me
4,6,-1,I will eventually turn out to be right or be dead
5,6,-1,e night after his announcement
6,1,-1,Jobs was annoyed and depressed .
734 5
 (5, 5),
1,6,-1,Jobs liked Stengel
2,6,-1,who had assigned a talented team led by Josh Quittner to make a robust iPad version of the magazine each week
3,6,-1,But he was upset to see Andy Serwer of Fortune there
4,6,-1,Tearing up
5,5,-1,he told Serwer how angry he still was about Fortune 's story two years earlier revealing details of his health and the stock options problems .
735 5
 (3, 3),
1,6,-1,There was one problem :  When Powell told her husband
2,6,-1,he said he didnt want to do it
3,5,-1,He was annoyed that she had arranged it behind his back
4,6,-1,im not going to get slotted in for a token meeting so that he can check off that he met with a CEO
5,6,-1,he told her .
736 2
 (2, 2),
1,6,-1,He had made the same offer in 2008
2,5,-1,but he 'd become annoyed when Obama 's strategist David Axelrod wasnt totally deferential .
857 6
 (2, 4),
1,6,-1,Steve goes in to pitch him
2,2,-1,but Joe could n't stand him
3,6,-1,Alcorn recalled
