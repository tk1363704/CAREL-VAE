5,6,-1,you ask me the use of this talisman
6,6,-1,Alas
7,6,-1,hitherto it has been only a source of misfortune to me
8,6,-1,being the cause of my separation from the one I love best on earth

1,6,-1,Jo 's ambition was to do something very splendid
2,6,-1,What it was
3,6,-1,she had no idea as yet
4,6,-1,but left it for time to tell her
5,6,-1,and meanwhile
6,6,-1,found her greatest affliction in the fact that she could n't read
7,6,-1,run
8,6,-1,and ride as much as she liked
9,6,-1,A quick temper
10,6,-1,sharp tongue
11,6,-1,and restless spirit were always getting her into scrapes
12,6,-1,and her life was a series of ups and downs
13,6,-1,which were both comic and pathetic
14,6,-1,But the training she received at Aunt March 's was just what she needed
15,0,-1,and the thought that she was doing something to support herself made her happy in spite of the perpetual  "  josy phine

2,6,-1,hoping he was feeling all right
3,6,-1,although he managed to release the cork without any accidents
4,6,-1,But after he had filled Father 's glass and turned to refill Lieutenant Kotler 's
5,6,-1,he lost his grip of the bottle somehow and it fell crashing
6,6,-1,glug glug glugging its contents out directly onto the young man 's lap
7,6,-1,What happened then was both unexpected and extremely unpleasant
8,5,-1,Lieutenant Kotler grew very angry with Pavel and no one not Bruno
9,6,-1,not Gretel
10,6,-1,not Mother and not even Father stepped in to stop him doing what he did next
11,6,-1,even though none of them could watch

2,6,-1,and he did not talk of her much to any one
3,6,-1,His family knew that he went to see her
4,0,-1,but there had grown up in the Cowperwood family a deep respect for the mental force of Frank
5,6,-1,He was genial
6,6,-1,cheerful
7,6,-1,gay at most times
8,6,-1,without being talkative
9,6,-1,and he was decidedly successful
10,6,-1,Everybody knew he was making money now
11,6,-1,His salary was fifty dollars a week
12,6,-1,and he was certain soon to get more .

1,6,-1,Bruno had a pain in his stomach and he could feel something growing inside him
2,5,-1,something that when it worked its way up from the lowest depths inside him to the outside world would either make him shout and scream that the whole thing was wrong and unfair and a big mistake for which somebody would pay one of these days
3,6,-1,or just make him burst into tears instead .

5,6,-1,' just eat them
6,6,-1,There 's lots left for our tea you dont have to worry about that
7,0,-1,The boy stared at the food in his hand for a moment and then looked up at Bruno with wide and grateful but terrified eyes
8,6,-1,He threw one more glance in the direction of the door and then seemed to make a decision
9,6,-1,because he thrust all three slices into his mouth in one go and gobbled them down in twenty seconds flat .

2,6,-1,To-day the king went the round of his relations
3,6,-1,showing the beautiful things given him by the white man a clear proof that he was much favoured by the  "  spirits
4,6,-1,"   for neither his father nor any of his forefathers had been so recognised and distinguished by any  "  sign "   as a rightful inheritor to the Uganda throne :  an anti-Christian interpretation of omens
5,6,-1,as rife in these dark regions now as it was in the time of King Nebuchadnezzar
6,6,-1,At midnight the three muskets were returned
7,0,-1,and I was so pleased with the young king 's prompt attitude and honesty
8,6,-1,I begged he would accept them .

8,6,-1,' im the only one here
9,6,-1,' what 's going to happen then
10,6,-1,' asked Bruno
11,6,-1,beginning to panic slightly
12,1,-1,an emotion that might encourage tears
13,6,-1,I might bleed to death . '
420 9
 (2, 5),
1,6,-1,Such was not at all the opinion of the majority of the guests
2,5,-1,Four or five of the ladies took flight at the bare suggestion and several men the most aristocratic of the company became angry at once
3,6,-1,"  Are you mad
4,6,-1,"   said one of them
5,6,-1,"  Do you want to see us all summoned as witnesses
6,6,-1,You have probably forgotten that Garcia affair
7,6,-1,and that rumpus at Jenny Fancy 's house
8,6,-1,A fine thing it would be to see

3,6,-1,what chance was there of being saved if your boat got smashed
4,6,-1,and so on unto infinity
5,6,-1,At last
6,2,-1,getting very tired of this  "  Portuguese Parliament "   of all talkers and no listeners
7,6,-1,I went aft to get a drink of water before turning in
8,6,-1,The harpooner s and other petty officers were grouped in the waist
9,6,-1,earnestly discussing the pros and cons of attack upon whales .

 (2, 2),
1,6,-1,For several weeks the rain was on and off and on and off and Bruno and Shmuel did not see as much of each other as they would have liked
2,4,-1,When they did meet Bruno found that he was starting to worry about his friend because he seemed to be getting even thinner by the day and his face was growing more and more grey .

8,6,-1,will you be quiet please
9,5,-1,' shouted Bruno
10,6,-1,staring at his sister in irritation
11,6,-1,It was bad enough having to come out here and ask for a favour from Lieutenant Kotler
12,6,-1,but it only  made things worse when his own sister teased him all the way through it .
1552 7

1,6,-1,Yet victory gladdened not his heart In that great struggle for achilles ' prizes

 (2, 1),
1,6,-1,After some time they received an offer of tea from one of their neighbours
2,0,-1,it was thankfully accepted
3,6,-1,and this introduced a light conversation with the gentleman who offered it
4,6,-1,which was the only time that anybody spoke to them during the evening

6,6,-1,would be angry

4,6,-1,The girls had never been called angel children before
5,6,-1,and thought it very agreeable
6,6,-1,especially Jo
7,6,-1,who had been considered a  ' sancho ' ever since she was born
8,0,-1,That was a very happy breakfast
9,6,-1,though they didnt get any of it
10,6,-1,And when they went away
11,6,-1,leaving comfort behind
12,6,-1,I think there were not in all the city four merrier people than the hungry little girls who gave away their breakfasts and contented themselves with bread and milk on Christmas morning .

2,6,-1,your Majesty
3,6,-1,' the Duchess began in a low
4,6,-1,weak voice Now
5,6,-1,I give you fair warning
6,6,-1,' shouted the Queen
7,6,-1,stamping on the ground as she spoke
8,6,-1,either you or your head must be off
9,6,-1,and that in about half no time
10,6,-1,Take your choice
11,6,-1,' The Duchess took her choice
12,6,-1,and was gone in a moment Let 's go on with the game
13,6,-1,' the Queen said to Alice
14,4,-1,and Alice was too much frightened to say a word
15,6,-1,but slowly followed her back to the croquet ground . The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen 's absence
16,6,-1,and were resting in the shade :  however
17,6,-1,the moment they saw her
18,6,-1,they hurried back to the game

1,6,-1,It may be said
2,6,-1,however
3,6,-1,in Grace 's defence that she gave Maggie every chance
4,3,-1,She marvelled at her own patience
5,6,-1,For two years after that moment
6,6,-1,when she decided that Maggie was  "  queer
7,6,-1,"   and that her beloved Paul was in real d5 of his losing his soul because of that  "  queerness
8,6,-1,"   she held her hand
9,6,-1,She was not naturally a patient woman she was not introspective enough to be that and she held no brief for Maggie
10,6,-1,Nevertheless for two whole years she held her hand

2,6,-1,another to form a reserve force at Mdaburu
3,6,-1,on the east flank of the wilderness
4,6,-1,and a third
5,6,-1,headed by Snay and Jafu
6,6,-1,to attack Mzanza
7,6,-1,At the first onset Snay and Jafu carried everything before them
8,0,-1,and became so excited over the amount of their loot that they lost all feelings of care or precaution .

2,6,-1,and to him Mr

4,6,-1,with all the strength and urgency which illness could command
5,6,-1,the interest of his mother-in-law and sisters
6,6,-1,Mr

 (12, 12),
1,6,-1,The whole being explained
2,6,-1,many obliging things were said by the Miss Thorpes of their wish of being better acquainted with her
3,6,-1,of being considered as already friends
4,6,-1,through the friendship of their brothers
5,6,-1,etc
6,6,-1,which Catherine heard with pleasure
7,6,-1,and answered with all the pretty expressions she could command
8,6,-1,and
9,6,-1,as the first proof of amity
10,6,-1,she was soon invited to accept an arm of the eldest Miss Thorpe
11,6,-1,and take a turn with her about the room
12,0,-1,Catherine was delighted with this extension of her Bath acquaintance
13,6,-1,and almost forgot Mr Tilney while she talked to Miss Thorpe
14,6,-1,Friendship is certainly the finest balm for the pangs of disappointed love .

1,6,-1,On leaving this interesting place
2,6,-1,with the widespread information of all the surrounding countries I had gained
3,6,-1,my mind was so impressed with the topographical features of all this part of Africa
4,6,-1,that in my heart I resolved I would make Rumanika as happy as he had made me
5,6,-1,and asked K'yengo his doctor
6,6,-1,of all things I possessed what the king would like best
7,3,-1,To my surprise I then learnt that Rumanika had set his heart on the revolving rifle I had brought for Mtesa the one
8,6,-1,in fact
9,6,-1,which he had prevented my sending on to Uganda in the hands of Kachuchu
10,6,-1,and he would have begged me for it before had his high-minded dignity

7,6,-1,I have an hundred things to say to you
8,6,-1,In the first place
9,6,-1,I was so afraid it would rain this morning
10,6,-1,just as I wanted to set off
11,6,-1,it looked very showery
12,1,-1,and that would have thrown me into agonies
13,6,-1,Do you know
14,6,-1,I saw the prettiest hat you can imagine
15,6,-1,in a shop window in Milsom Street just now   very like yours
16,6,-1,only with coquelicot ribbons instead of green

7,6,-1,"   said he
8,6,-1,"  I think I am sure that I have heard or that I have read I cannot say which some story about a Mademoiselle de Chalusse

2,6,-1,without turning
3,6,-1,He came beside her
4,6,-1,and she looked up smiling
5,6,-1,the reverie evoked by Schubert partly vanishing  or melting into another mood
6,6,-1,Suddenly he bent over and pressed his lips firmly to hers
7,6,-1,His mustache thrilled her with its silky touch
8,6,-1,She stopped playing and tried to catch her breath
9,6,-1,for
10,6,-1,strong as she was
11,6,-1,it affected her breathing
12,6,-1,her heart was beating like a trip hammer

14,6,-1,"  Oh
15,6,-1,"   or
16,6,-1,"  You must n't
17,6,-1,"   but rose and walked over to a window
18,6,-1,where she lifted a curtain

14,6,-1,It must have been lonely for you at times
15,6,-1,' very lonely
16,6,-1,' said Gretel in a determined voice .
1024 4
 (1, 1),
1,0,-1,It was as though they both inwardly realised that there was trouble for them of every kind waiting outside and that they could only definitely realise their 0 by building a wall around themselves
2,6,-1,They knew perhaps in their secret hearts
3,6,-1,or at any rate Martin knew
4,6,-1,that they could not hold their castle for long .
1970 8
 (8, 1),
1,6,-1,But they didnt find anything at all that might give them a clue to Shmuel 's papa 's disappearance
2,6,-1,and it started to get darker
3,6,-1,Bruno looked up at the sky and it looked like it might rain again
4,6,-1,' im sorry
5,6,-1,Shmuel
6,6,-1,' he said eventually
7,6,-1,' im sorry we didnt find any evidence
8,1,-1,Shmuel nodded his head sadly .
1423 5
 (4, 2),
1,6,-1,Once
2,6,-1,I got a horrible haircut that left me looking I got electrocuted
3,6,-1,For months
4,4,-1,I felt self-conscious about going outside my house
5,6,-1,I swear everyone was laughing at me .
1730 12
 (8, 9),
1,6,-1,Suddenly one of the men
2,6,-1,in lifting his net
3,6,-1,slipped on the smooth bottom of the boat
4,6,-1,jolting one of the oars
5,6,-1,There was a gleam of light below as the school turned they had all disappeared instantly
6,6,-1,We had been so busy that we had not noticed the dimensions of our catch
7,6,-1,but now
8,0,-1,to our great joy
9,6,-1,we found that we had at least eight hundred fish nearly as large as herrings
10,6,-1,We at once returned to the ship
11,6,-1,having been absent only two hours
12,6,-1,during which we had caught sufficient to provide all hands with three good meals .
1764 9
 (5, 6),
1,6,-1,For the boat was crumbled into innumerable fragments
2,6,-1,and the three hundred fathoms of line
3,6,-1,in a perfect maze of entanglement
4,6,-1,appeared to be wrapped about the writhing trunk of the whale
5,0,-1,Happily
6,6,-1,there were two boats disengaged
7,6,-1,so that they were able very promptly to rescue the sufferers from their perilous position in the boiling vortex of foam by which they were surrounded
8,6,-1,Meanwhile
9,6,-1,the remaining boat had an easy task .
4 2
 (2, 1),
1,6,-1,They dont even have a word for vegetarian
2,2,-1,he complained ( incorrectly ) in a phone call to Alcorn .
1957 8
 (6, 4),(6, 5),
1,6,-1,' well
2,6,-1,if that 's the case
3,6,-1,' said Bruno
4,6,-1,' and if I had a pair of striped pyjamas too
5,6,-1,then I could come over on a visit and no one would be any the wiser
6,0,-1,Shmuel 's face brightened up and he broke into a wide smile
7,6,-1,' do you think so
8,6,-1,' he asked .
1300 19
 (11, 9),
1,6,-1,These two felt un utterably bound to each other
2,6,-1,Cowperwood
3,6,-1,once he came to understand her
4,6,-1,fancied that he had found the one person with whom he could live happily the rest of his life
5,6,-1,She was so young
6,6,-1,so confident
7,6,-1,so hopeful
8,6,-1,so un dismayed
9,6,-1,All these months since they had first begun to reach out to each other he had been hourly contrasting her with his wife
10,6,-1,As a matter of fact
11,1,-1,his dissatisfaction
12,6,-1,though it may be said to have been faint up to this time
13,6,-1,was now surely tending to become real enough
14,6,-1,Still
15,6,-1,his children were pleasing to him
16,6,-1,his home beautiful
17,6,-1,Lillian
18,6,-1,phlegmatic and now thin
19,6,-1,was still not homely .
1072 7
 (2, 2),
1,6,-1,When she saw him she stood speechless where she was
2,4,-1,The change in him terrified her so that her heart seemed to leap into her throat choking her
3,6,-1,The colour had drained from his face
4,6,-1,leaving it dry and yellow
5,6,-1,He had an amazing resemblance to his father
6,6,-1,his eyes had exactly the same bewildered expression as though he were lost and yet he seemed quite calm
7,6,-1,his only movement was one hand that wandered up and down his waistcoat feeling the buttons one after the other .
1252 5
 (1, 1),
1,1,-1,Butler was sorry that he had called his youngest a baggage
2,6,-1,but these children God bless his soul were a great annoyance
3,6,-1,Why
4,6,-1,in the name of all the saints
5,6,-1,wasnt this house good enough for them
2731 2
 (1, 1),
1,2,-1,Her resentment opened out a little every year :  the embrace she had glimpsed
2,6,-1,Ennis 's fishing trips once or twice a year with Jack Twist and never a vacation with her and the girls .
2799 6
 (3, 1),
1,6,-1,The people begin to point at us eagerly as they recognize a tribute train rolling into the city
2,6,-1,I step away from the window
3,2,-1,sickened by their excitement
4,6,-1,knowing they cant wait to watch us die
5,6,-1,But Peeta holds his ground
6,6,-1,actually waving and smiling at the gawking crowd .
478 14
 (5, 4),
1,6,-1,She spoke these words with a sort of satisfaction
2,6,-1,expecting that the marquis would betray his disappointed covetousness by some significant gesture or exclamation
3,6,-1,and she was already prepared to rejoice at his confusion
4,6,-1,But her expectations were not realized
5,1,-1,Instead of evincing the slightest dismay or even regret
6,6,-1,de Valorsay drew a long breath
7,6,-1,as if a great burden had been lifted from his heart
8,6,-1,and his eyes sparkled with apparent delight
9,6,-1,"  Then I may venture to speak
10,6,-1,"   he exclaimed
11,6,-1,with unconcealed satisfaction
12,6,-1,"  I will speak
13,6,-1,mademoiselle
14,6,-1,if you will deign to allow me .  "
2427 24
 (7, 9),
1,6,-1,"  Yes
2,6,-1,very much indeed
3,6,-1,I fancy
4,6,-1,Mr Allen thinks her the prettiest girl in Bath
5,6,-1,"  I dare say he does
6,6,-1,and I do not know any man who is a better judge of beauty than Mr Allen
7,0,-1,I need not ask you whether you are happy here
8,6,-1,my dear Catherine
9,6,-1,with such a companion and friend as Isabella Thorpe
10,6,-1,it would be impossible for you to be otherwise
11,6,-1,and the Allens
12,6,-1,I am sure
13,6,-1,are very kind to you
14,6,-1,"    "  Yes
15,6,-1,very kind
16,6,-1,I never was so happy before
17,6,-1,and now you are come it will be more delightful than ever
18,6,-1,how good it is of you to come so far on purpose to see me
19,6,-1,James accepted this tribute of gratitude
20,6,-1,and qualified his conscience for accepting it too
21,6,-1,by saying with perfect sincerity
22,6,-1,"  Indeed
23,6,-1,Catherine
24,6,-1,I love you dearly .  "
594 3
 (1, 1),
1,0,-1,Father always stayed to listen and Bruno did too because there was nothing he liked more than hearing Grandmother break into her full voice and soak up the applause of the guests at the end
2,6,-1,Plus
3,6,-1,La Vie en Rose gave him chills and  made the tiny hairs on the back of his neck stand on end .
2654 1
 (1, 1),
1,0,-1,We decided to leave at once  . It 's all right living in a house for a little while   but you feel more free and easy and comfortable on a raft
1529 7
 (4, 4),
1,6,-1,He unto high Olympus swiftly came
2,6,-1,To the great gathering of immortal Gods
3,6,-1,Where all assembled watched the war of men
4,0,-1,These longing for the trojans ' triumph
5,6,-1,those For Danaan victory
6,6,-1,so with diverse wills Watched they the strife
7,6,-1,the slayers and the slain .
2371 2
 (2, 2),
1,6,-1,My mother was worried about telling him he had a daughter not a son
2,0,-1,but he says he looked into my eyes and was delighted .
587 13
 (10, 10),
1,6,-1,' indeed
2,6,-1,' said Lieutenant Kotler
3,6,-1,nodding his head wisely as if such things were only distant memories to him now
4,6,-1,despite the fact that he was
5,6,-1,as Gretel had pointed out
6,6,-1,no more than a teenager himself
7,6,-1,' yes
8,6,-1,I made many swings myself when I was a child
9,6,-1,My friends and I had many happy afternoons together playing on them
10,3,-1,Bruno felt astonished that he could have anything in common with him ( and even more 3d to learn that Lieutenant Kotler had ever had friends )
11,6,-1,' so what do you think
12,6,-1,' he asked
13,6,-1,' are there any around
944 8
 (7, 7),
1,6,-1,"  Said
2,6,-1,"   he repeated
3,6,-1,stammering a little
4,6,-1,"  Why only
5,6,-1,Nothing
6,6,-1,except that she cared for you and hoped that you would be happy
7,4,-1,She was afraid that it would all be strange for you at first
8,6,-1,Perhaps I have been interfering
2190 5
 (1, 3),
1,1,-1,One night Marty cried at bedtime
2,6,-1,telling his mother that when they were on visits
3,6,-1,Felix and June would make  " mean jokes "  about Kaleigh
4,6,-1,and that Mariel and Joel would laugh about the jokes
5,6,-1," but they make me feel sad
1212 22
 (5, 6),
1,6,-1,In the midst of this early work he married Mrs
2,6,-1,Semple
3,6,-1,There was no vast to-do about it
4,6,-1,as he did not want any and his bride-to-be was nervous
5,4,-1,4some of public opinion
6,6,-1,His family did not entirely approve
7,6,-1,She was too old
8,6,-1,his mother and father thought
9,6,-1,and then Frank
10,6,-1,with his prospects
11,6,-1,could have done much better
12,6,-1,His sister Anna fancied that Mrs
13,6,-1,Semple was designing
14,6,-1,which was
15,6,-1,of course
16,6,-1,not true
17,6,-1,His brothers
18,6,-1,Joseph and Edward
19,6,-1,were interested
20,6,-1,but not certain as to what they actually thought
21,6,-1,since Mrs
22,6,-1,Semple was good-looking and had some money .
1039 8
 (6, 5),
1,6,-1,The Lyric Theatre was their destination
2,6,-1,Maggie drew a breath as they stepped into the hall where there stood two large stout commissionaires in blue uniforms
3,6,-1,gold buttons
4,6,-1,and white gloves
5,6,-1,People pushed past them and hurried down the stairs on either side as though a theatre were a Nothing
6,1,-1,Maggie stood there fingering her gloves and feeling lonely
7,6,-1,The oil painting of a beautiful lady with a row of shining teeth faced her
8,6,-1,There were also some palms and a hole in the wall with a man behind it .
499 7
 (5, 4),
1,6,-1,Mother had walked into her own bedroom by then but Lars
2,6,-1,the butler
3,6,-1,was in there
4,6,-1,packing her things too
5,1,-1,She sighed and threw her hands in the air in frustration before marching back to the staircase
6,6,-1,followed by Bruno
7,6,-1,who wasnt going to let the matter drop without an explanation .
1521 5
 (1, 1),
1,4,-1,Thou hadst said that in the strife of that dread day Huge tireless Giants or strong Titans warred
2,6,-1,So fiercely blazed the wildfire of their strife
3,6,-1,Now
4,6,-1,when they clashed with swords
5,6,-1,now when they leapt Hurling huge stones .
205 7
 (1, 1),
1,4,-1,A 4 that you were married
2,6,-1,'' he said
3,6,-1,with a boldness that made me blush
4,6,-1,As for Mademoiselle
5,6,-1,a color that vied with the June roses charged through her cheeks
6,6,-1,She stooped to pick up her sewing
7,6,-1,but Nick was before her .
320 3
 (2, 2),
1,6,-1,But Nick was one to carry by storm a position which another might wait to reconnoitre
2,3,-1,The first sensation of our host was no doubt astonishment
3,6,-1,but he was soon laughing over a vivid account of our adventures on the keel boat .
673 7
 (2, 2),
1,6,-1,As I bent to my oar
2,1,-1,I felt very sorry for what had happened
3,6,-1,Here were half the crew guilty of an act of violence upon an officer
4,6,-1,which
5,6,-1,according to the severe code under which we lived
6,6,-1,merited punishment as painful as could be inflicted
7,6,-1,and lasting for the rest of the voyage .
962 7
 (5, 4),
1,6,-1,He greeted the aunts
2,6,-1,then shook hands with Maggie
3,6,-1,He gave her one glance and she
4,6,-1,suddenly feeling that that glance had not the things in it that she had wanted
5,4,-1,was frightened
6,6,-1,her confidence left her
7,6,-1,she felt that if she did not have a word alone with him she would die .
1081 10
 (7, 8),
1,6,-1,He did indeed seem to lead a mysterious life of his own and paid very little attention to Maggie
2,6,-1,asking her once whether she did not think The Golden Ass wonderful
3,6,-1,and what did she think of Petronius
4,6,-1,and when Maggie laughed and said that she was glad to say she never read anything
5,6,-1,he left her in an agitated horror
6,6,-1,Lady Rachel Seddon was very grand and splendid
7,4,-1,and frightened Katherine
8,6,-1,She was related to every kind of duke and marquis
9,6,-1,and although that fact did not impress Maggie in the least
10,6,-1,it did seem to remove Lady Rachel into quite another world .
2088 21
 (7, 7),
1,6,-1,Malcolm felt as averse as did the French princesses to burgher wealth and splendour
2,6,-1,and his mind had not opened to understand burgher worth and weight
3,6,-1,and when he saw the princes John and Humfrey
4,6,-1,and even his own king
5,6,-1,seeking out city dames and accosting them with friendly looks
6,6,-1,it seemed to him a degrading truckling to riches
7,4,-1,from which he was anxious to save his future queen
8,6,-1,but when he would have offered his arm to Lady Joan
9,6,-1,he saw her already being led away by an alderman measuring at least a yard across the shoulders
10,6,-1,and the good natured Earl of March
11,6,-1,seeing him at a loss
12,6,-1,presented him to a round merry wife in a scarlet petticoat and black boddice
13,6,-1,its plump curves wreathed with geld chains
14,6,-1,who began pitying him for having been sent to the wars so young
15,6,-1,being
16,6,-1,as usual
17,6,-1,charmed into pity by his soft appealing eyes and unconscious grace
18,6,-1,would not believe his assertions that he was neither a captive nor a Frenchman
19,6,-1,dont tell her
20,6,-1,when he spoke like a str5
21,6,-1,and halted from a wound . '
2656 1
 (1, 1),
1,1,-1,Well  of course  we were all very unhappy for our friend the Duke  but he said  ' i 'll be happier if you do things for me . Bring me my dinner  '
515 2
 (1, 2),
1,1,-1,But there was something about the new house that  made Bruno think that no one ever laughed there
2,6,-1,that there was nothing to laugh at and nothing to be happy about .
2257 4
 (2, 2),
1,6,-1,There was nothing in any of the party which could recommend them as companions to the Dashwoods
2,2,-1,but the cold insipid nature of Lady Middleton was so particularly repulsive
3,6,-1,that in comparison of it the gravity of Colonel Brandon
4,6,-1,and even the boisterous mirth of Sir John and his mother-in-law was interesting .
966 4
 (1, 1),
1,0,-1,Maggie was maliciously pleased to observe that Miss Avies had not expected these additions to her number and was now in d5 of an uncomfortable squashing
2,6,-1,there was
3,6,-1,indeed
4,6,-1,a polite little struggle between Miss Avies and Aunt Anne as to who should have the corner with a wooden arm upon which to rest .
1134 5
 (2, 2),
1,6,-1,As will be imagined
2,3,-1,these words took the Sultan by surprise
3,6,-1,and he looked at me to see how I should take the statement of the princess
4,6,-1,As I was unable to speak
5,6,-1,I placed my hand on my head to show that it was true .
941 7
 (4, 4),
1,6,-1,I could n't imagine what they were all about
2,6,-1,it wasnt the ordinary London congregation
3,6,-1,it was almost the ordinary London service and yet not quite
4,0,-1,there was an air of expectation and even excitement which is most unusual in a London church
5,6,-1,Then there was Warlock
6,6,-1,Of course one could see at once that he was an extraordinary man
7,6,-1,a kind of prophet all on his own
719 7
 (2, 4),
1,6,-1,He perked up when the reporter said something like
2,0,-1,dont get excited
3,6,-1,Mac users
4,6,-1,because it wont work with Macs
5,6,-1,ncaid said to himself
6,6,-1,Ha
7,6,-1,I can fix that
1259 6
 (5, 4),
1,6,-1,Aileen had swept on to Cowperwood and his mother
2,6,-1,who was near him
3,6,-1,She had removed from her arm the black satin ribbon which held her train and kicked the skirts loose and free
4,6,-1,Her eyes gleamed almost pleadingly for all her hauteur
5,0,-1,like a spirited collie 's
6,6,-1,and her even teeth showed beautifully .
869 7
 (6, 6),
1,6,-1,He was rather pathetic
2,6,-1,having drunk nothing out of respect to the occasion
3,6,-1,he felt
4,6,-1,somewhere deep down in him
5,6,-1,a persistent exaltation that his brother Charles was dead
6,1,-1,but he knew that it was not decent to allow this feeling to conquer him and he was truly anxious to protect and comfort his niece so well as he was able
7,6,-1,Early in the afternoon he suggested that they should go for a walk .
2686 8
 (4, 3),
1,6,-1,It is very unlucky
2,6,-1,but as I have actually paid the visit
3,6,-1,we cannot escape the acquaintance now
4,3,-1,The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished
5,6,-1,that of Mrs
6,6,-1,Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest
7,6,-1,though when the first tumult of joy was over
8,6,-1,she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while .
2595 1
 (1, 1),
1,1,-1,Soon I arrived in Queensferry  .  When I saw people looking strangely at me 
174 12
 (11, 11),
1,6,-1,In a little while I felt tired of the monotony
2,6,-1,and wished to hang up a curtain
3,6,-1,that I might lie down in privacy and sleep till the king was ready
4,6,-1,but the officers in waiting forbade this
5,6,-1,as contrary to law
6,6,-1,and left me the only alternative of walking up and down the court to kill time
7,6,-1,spreading my umbrella against the powerful rays of the sun
8,6,-1,A very little of that made me fidgety and impetuous
9,6,-1,which the Waganda noticed
10,6,-1,and
11,1,-1,from fear of the consequences
12,6,-1,they began to close the gate to prevent my walking away .
1732 11
 (8, 8),
1,6,-1,Now
2,6,-1,with us
3,6,-1,whenever the weather was doubtful or squally looking
4,6,-1,we shortened sail
5,6,-1,and kept it fast till better weather came along
6,6,-1,being quite careless whether we made one mile a day or one hundred
7,6,-1,But just because nobody took any notice of our progress as the days passed
8,4,-1,we were occasionally startled to find how far we had really got
9,6,-1,This was certainly the case with all of us forward
10,6,-1,even to me who had some experience
11,6,-1,so well used had I now become to the leisurely way of getting along .
1680 4
 (1, 1),
1,3,-1,It was strange to see how all the people flocked together bare
2,6,-1,to see the King looking out of the Council window
3,6,-1,At night my Lord told me how my orders that I drew last night about giving us power to act
4,6,-1,are granted by the Council .
2571 1
 (1, 1),
1,5,-1,Ball-of - Fat 
1153 33
 (11, 11),
1,6,-1,When the dervish saw that the prince 's mind was made up
2,6,-1,he drew a ball from a bag that lay near him
3,6,-1,and held it out
4,6,-1,"  If it must be so
5,6,-1,"   he said
6,6,-1,with a sigh
7,6,-1,"  take this
8,6,-1,and when you have mounted your horse throw the ball in front of you
9,6,-1,It will roll on till it reaches the foot of a mountain
10,6,-1,and when it stops you will stop also
11,4,-1,You will then throw the bridle on your horse 's neck without any fear of his straying
12,6,-1,and will dismount
13,6,-1,On each side you will see vast heaps of big black stones
14,6,-1,and will hear a multitude of insulting voices
15,6,-1,but pay no heed to them
16,6,-1,and
17,6,-1,above all
18,6,-1,beware of ever turning your head
19,6,-1,If you do
20,6,-1,you will instantly become a black stone like the rest
21,6,-1,For those stones are in reality men like yourself
22,6,-1,who have been on the same quest
23,6,-1,and have failed
24,6,-1,as I fear that you may fail also
25,6,-1,If you manage to avoid this pitfall
26,6,-1,and to reach the top of the mountain
27,6,-1,you will find there the Talking Bird in a splendid cage
28,6,-1,and you can ask of him where you are to seek the Singing Tree and the Golden Water
29,6,-1,That is all I have to say
30,6,-1,You know what you have to do
31,6,-1,and what to avoid
32,6,-1,but if you are wise you will think of it no more
33,6,-1,but return whence you have come .  "
2406 6
 (6, 6),
1,6,-1,Here Catherine and Isabella
2,6,-1,arm in arm
3,6,-1,again tasted the sweets of friendship in an unreserved conversation
4,6,-1,they talked much
5,6,-1,and with much enjoyment
6,1,-1,but again was Catherine disappointed in her hope of re seeing her partner .
179 13
 (1, 1),
1,2,-1,And all the men of the camp laugh together at the wretched Ntalo 's defeat
2,6,-1,but Ntalo wont be done
3,6,-1,so retorts by saying
4,6,-1,"  Sangizo
5,6,-1,you may laugh at me because I am an orphan
6,6,-1,but what are you
7,6,-1,you are a savage a Mshezi
8,6,-1,you come from the Mashenzi
9,6,-1,and you wear skins
10,6,-1,not cloths
11,6,-1,as men do
12,6,-1,so hold your impudent tongue "
13,6,-1,and the camp pealed with merry boisterous laughter again .
636 15
 (10, 8),(10, 9),
1,6,-1,' well
2,6,-1,' said Bruno
3,6,-1,trying to look sad
4,6,-1,' you 're probably right
5,6,-1,You wont tell anyone
6,6,-1,will you
7,6,-1,' She shook her head
8,6,-1,' no one
9,6,-1,Except my own imaginary friend
10,0,-1,Bruno gasped
11,6,-1,' do you have one
12,6,-1,' he asked
13,6,-1,picturing her at another part of the fence
14,6,-1,talking to a girl her own age

4,6,-1,A thousand alarming presentiment of evil to her beloved Catherine from this terrific separation must oppress her heart with 1
5,6,-1,and drown her in tears for the last day or two of their being together
6,6,-1,and advice of the most important and applicable nature must of course flow from her wise lips in their parting conference in her closet
7,6,-1,Cautions against the violence of such noblemen and baronets as delight in forcing young ladies away to some remote farm house
8,6,-1,must

14,6,-1,smiling complacently
15,6,-1,"  I must say it
16,6,-1,though I am his mother
17,6,-1,that there is not a more agreeable young man in the world
18,6,-1,This inapplicable answer might have been too much for the comprehension of many
19,6,-1,but it did not puzzle Mrs

11,6,-1,that it would soon take flight .
194 8
 (5, 6),
1,6,-1,So the four sang
2,6,-1,each in turn
3,6,-1,and died in the sight of some who pitied
4,6,-1,and some who feared
5,5,-1,and some who hated
6,6,-1,for the sake of land and women
7,6,-1,So the four went beyond the power of gold and gewgaw
8,6,-1,and were dragged in the mire around the walls and flung into the yellow waters of the river .
1049 7
 (3, 4),
1,6,-1,Meanwhile
2,6,-1,how they must all have been talking
3,0,-1,She felt no especial 5 against Caroline Smith
4,6,-1,It had been her own fault for trusting that note to her honour
5,6,-1,Caroline had no honour
6,6,-1,of course
7,6,-1,Maggie might have guessed that from the way that she talked about other people .
1104 12
 (9, 9),
1,6,-1,The moment she saw Maggie she was resolved
2,6,-1,here was just the creature
3,6,-1,a mouse of a girl
4,6,-1,no parents
5,6,-1,no money
6,6,-1,no appearance
7,6,-1,nothing to make her proud or above herself
8,6,-1,some one to be moulded and trained in the way she should go
9,3,-1,To her great 3 she discovered that Paul was at once attracted by Maggie :  had she ever wondered at anything she would have wondered at this
10,6,-1,but she decided that it was because she herself had made the suggestion
11,6,-1,Dear Paul
12,6,-1,he was always so eager to fall in with any of her proposals .
2435 19
 (15, 14),
1,6,-1,Mr Tilney and his companion
2,6,-1,who continued
3,6,-1,though slowly
4,6,-1,to approach
5,6,-1,were immediately preceded by a lady
6,6,-1,an acquaintance of Mrs
7,6,-1,Thorpe
8,6,-1,and this lady stopping to speak to her
9,6,-1,they
10,6,-1,as belonging to her
11,6,-1,stopped likewise
12,6,-1,and Catherine
13,6,-1,catching Mr Tilney 's eye
14,6,-1,instantly received from him the smiling tribute of recognition
15,0,-1,She returned it with pleasure
16,6,-1,and then advancing still nearer
17,6,-1,he spoke both to her and Mrs
18,6,-1,Allen
19,6,-1,by whom he was very civilly acknowledged .
2519 7
 (7, 7),
1,6,-1,It was heart-breaking work - all uphill again
2,6,-1,back over the ground they had already travelled
3,6,-1,When they felt that they really could n't run any more
4,6,-1,even to save their lives
5,6,-1,they all dropped down in the damp moss beside a waterfall and behind a big boulder
6,6,-1,panting
7,3,-1,They were surprised to see how high they had already got .
153 8
 (6, 6),
1,6,-1,Neither his father nor any of his forefathers had had such a great favour shown them
2,6,-1,He was alarmed
3,6,-1,he confessed
4,6,-1,when he heard we were coming to visit him
5,6,-1,thinking we might prove some fearful monsters that were not quite human
6,0,-1,but now he was delighted beyond all measure with what he saw of us
7,6,-1,A messenger should be sent at once to the king of Uganda to inform him of our intention to visit him
8,6,-1,with his own favourable report of us .
800 9
 (5, 5),
1,6,-1,The Sultan was transported with delight on learning the result of the interview
2,6,-1,and his opinion of the doctor 's skill was raised still higher when
3,6,-1,on the following day
4,6,-1,the princess behaved towards him in such a way as to persuade him that her complete cure would not be long delayed
5,0,-1,However he contented himself with assuring her how happy he was to see her health so much improved
6,6,-1,and exhorted her to make every use of so clever a physician
7,6,-1,and to repose entire confidence in him
8,6,-1,Then he retired
9,6,-1,without awaiting any reply from the princess .
2833 2
 (2, 2),
1,6,-1,Poor Meg seldom complained
2,2,-1,but a sense of injustice made her feel bitter toward everyone sometimes
74 2
 (1, 1),
1,5,-1,His ire stoked by hearing from Markkula that Jobs had spent the previous evening trying to subvert him
2,6,-1,Sculley walked over to Jobs 's office on Tuesday morning .
2611 2
 (1, 1),
1,0,-1,I was still very young 
2,6,-1,Instead 
2413 15
 (6, 2),
1,6,-1,"  But you should not persuade me that I think so very much about Mr Tilney
2,6,-1,for perhaps I may never see him again
3,6,-1,Not see him again
4,6,-1,My dearest creature
5,6,-1,do not talk of it
6,1,-1,I am sure you would be miserable if you thought so
7,6,-1,"   "  No
8,6,-1,indeed
9,6,-1,I should not
10,6,-1,I do not pretend to say that I was not very much pleased with him
11,6,-1,but while I have Udolpho to read
12,6,-1,I feel as if nobody could make me miserable
13,6,-1,The dreadful black veil
14,6,-1,My dear Isabella
15,6,-1,I am sure there must be Laurentina 's skeleton behind it .  "
2378 10
 (4, 4),
1,6,-1,When the hour of departure drew near
2,6,-1,the maternal anxiety of Mrs
3,6,-1,Morland will be naturally supposed to be most severe
4,1,-1,A thousand alarming presentiment of evil to her beloved Catherine from this terrific separation must oppress her heart with 1
5,6,-1,and drown her in tears for the last day or two of their being together
6,6,-1,and advice of the most important and applicable nature must of course flow from her wise lips in their parting conference in her closet
7,6,-1,Cautions against the violence of such noblemen and baronets as delight in forcing young ladies away to some remote farm house
8,6,-1,must
9,6,-1,at such a moment
10,6,-1,relieve the fulness of her heart .
1084 12
 (3, 3),
1,6,-1,With Paul Trenchard there was no effort
2,6,-1,no deliberate slipping out of one world into another one
3,0,-1,He was frankly delighted to tell Maggie everything all about skeaton on Sea and its delights
4,6,-1,about the church and its marvellous east window
5,6,-1,about the choir and the difficulties with the choir boys and the necessity for repairing the organ
6,6,-1,about the troubles with the churchwardens
7,6,-1,especially one Mr
8,6,-1,Bellows
9,6,-1,who
10,6,-1,in his cantankerous and dyspeptic objections to everything that any one proposed
11,6,-1,became quite a lively figure to Maggie 's imagination
12,6,-1,about the St .
408 16
 (11, 11),
1,6,-1,You could not say that M
2,6,-1,Fortunat was angry
3,6,-1,Such a man
4,6,-1,as cold and as smooth as a hundred franc piece
5,6,-1,has no useless passions
6,6,-1,But he was intensely irritated to hear his client foolishly chanting the paeons of victory
7,6,-1,while he was compelled to conceal his grief at the loss of his forty thousand francs
8,6,-1,deep in the recesses of his heart
9,6,-1,So
10,6,-1,far from being touched by the marquis 's evident alarm
11,0,-1,it pleased him to be able to turn the dagger in the wound he had just inflicted
12,6,-1,"  You must excuse my incredulity
13,6,-1,"   said he
14,6,-1,"  It comes entirely from something you
15,6,-1,yourself
16,6,-1,told me about a week ago .  "
898 9
 (4, 1),(4, 2),(4, 3),
1,6,-1,When at last she found herself
2,6,-1,a tiny figure
3,6,-1,standing upon the vast platform under the high black dome
4,0,-1,the noise and confusion excited and delighted her
5,6,-1,She rose to the waves of sound as a swimmer rises in the sea
6,6,-1,her heart beat fast
7,6,-1,and she was so eagerly engaged in looking about her
8,6,-1,in staring at the hurrying people
9,6,-1,in locating the shrill screams of the engines
935 5
 (2, 2),
1,6,-1,Maggie soon discovered that Mr
2,0,-1,Magnus was very happy to sit in their house even though Aunt Anne was not present
3,6,-1,His attitude seemed to be that the atmosphere that she left behind her was enough for him and that he could not
4,6,-1,in justice
5,6,-1,expect any more .
2091 19
 (19, 19),
1,6,-1,He had shot up suddenly to a fair height
2,6,-1,had almost lost his lameness
3,6,-1,and gained much more appearance of health and power of enduring fatigue
4,6,-1,His nerves had become less painfully sensitive
5,6,-1,and when after his first skirmish
6,6,-1,during which he had kept close to King James
7,6,-1,far too much terrified to stir an inch from him
8,6,-1,he had not only found himself perfectly safe
9,6,-1,but had been much praised for his valour
10,6,-1,he had been so much pleased with himself that he quite wished for another occasion of displaying his bravery
11,6,-1,and
12,6,-1,what with use
13,6,-1,and what with the increasing spirit of pugnacity
14,6,-1,he was as sincere as Ralf Percy in abusing the French for never coming to a pitched battle
15,6,-1,Perhaps
16,6,-1,indeed
17,6,-1,Malcolm spoke even more eagerly than Ralf
18,6,-1,in his own 3 and gratification at finding himself no coward
19,4,-1,and his 4 lest Percy should detect that he ever had been supposed to be such .
19 5
 (3, 1),
1,6,-1,You might want to buy us for a few hundred thousand dollars
2,6,-1,Jobs said when they got there
3,3,-1,Wozniak was stunned by this ridiculous
4,6,-1,suggestion
5,6,-1,but Jobs persisted .
1993 4
 (3, 2),
1,6,-1,Emperor Huizong of Song and Emperor Qianlong of Qing led drastically different lives
2,6,-1,While Huizong 's misfortune permeates his sparse
3,5,-1,embittered writing style
4,6,-1,Qianlong 's work overflows with richness and content .
1862 12
 (9, 9),
1,6,-1,There were sixteen white men on board the CHANCE
2,6,-1,including the skipper
3,6,-1,drawn as usual from various European and American sources
4,6,-1,the rest of her large crew of over forty all told being made up of Maories and half-breeds
5,6,-1,One common interest united them
6,6,-1,making them the most jolly crowd I ever saw their devotion to their commander
7,6,-1,There was here to be found no jealousy of the Maories being officers and harpooner s
8,6,-1,no black looks or discontented murmuring
9,0,-1,all hands seemed particularly well satisfied with their lot in all its bearings
10,6,-1,so that
11,6,-1,although the old tub was malodorous enough to turn even a pretty strong stomach
12,6,-1,it was a leasure to visit her cheerful crowd for the sake of their enlivening society .
597 5
 (4, 1),
1,6,-1,Grandfather was very proud of his son when he saw him in his new uniform but Grandmother was the only one who seemed unimpressed
2,6,-1,After dinner had been served
3,6,-1,and after she and Gretel and Bruno had performed their latest production
4,1,-1,she sat down sadly in one of the armchairs and looked at Father
5,6,-1,shaking her head as if he were a huge disappointment to her .
69 2
 (2, 2),
1,6,-1,By early 1985 Burrell Smith was also ready to leave
2,4,-1,He had worried that it would be hard to quit if Jobs tried to talk him out of it
1047 3
 (1, 2),
1,1,-1,I advised that strongly against my sister 's opinion because I thought you were n't happy
2,6,-1,You didnt make friends amongst our friends
3,6,-1,and I thought you should have the chance of finding some who were younger and gayer than we were .
844 13
 (8, 7),
1,6,-1,No one knew of a lake to supply the waters
2,6,-1,nor where they came from
3,6,-1,That they flowed into the lake there was no doubt as I could see by the trickling waters in some few places and they lay exactly on the equator
4,6,-1,Rising out of the valley
5,6,-1,I found all the country just as hilly as before
6,6,-1,but many of the rush drains going to northward
7,6,-1,and in the dells were such magnificent trees
8,3,-1,they quite took me by surprise
9,6,-1,clean trunked
10,6,-1,they towered up just as so many great pillars
11,6,-1,and then spread out their high branches like a canopy over us
12,6,-1,I thought of the blue gums of Australia
13,6,-1,and believed these would beat them .
130 15
 (15, 15),
1,6,-1,Her old mistress
2,6,-1,she said
3,6,-1,died well stricken in years
4,6,-1,and
5,6,-1,as she had succeeded her
6,6,-1,the people of her country invited Singinya to marry her
7,6,-1,because feuds had arisen about the rights of succession
8,6,-1,and it was better a prince
9,6,-1,whom they thought best suited by birth and good qualities
10,6,-1,should head their warriors
11,6,-1,and keep all in order
12,6,-1,At that moment Singinya was out in the field fighting his enemies
13,6,-1,and she was sure
14,6,-1,when he heard I was here
15,1,-1,that he would be very sorry he had missed seeing me .
519 5
 (5, 2),
1,6,-1,' bruno
2,6,-1,I want you to go upstairs and unpack and I want you to do it now
3,6,-1,' said Mother in an unfriendly voice
4,6,-1,and he knew that she meant business so he turned round and marched away without another word
5,1,-1,He could feel tears springing up behind his eyes but he was determined that he would n't allow them to appear .
923 6
 (2, 2),
1,6,-1,Her 4 was of Martin
2,4,-1,She 4ed very deeply his influence upon her husband
3,6,-1,During Martin 's absence she and Amy had managed very successfully to have the house as they wished it
4,6,-1,John Warlock
5,6,-1,the master
6,6,-1,had been too deeply occupied with the affairs of the soul to be concerned also with the affairs of the body .
1465 3
 (2, 2),
1,6,-1,In hospital
2,1,-1,there was little girl who was suffering from a very rare and serious disease
3,6,-1,She had little brother who was just 5 years old .
537 9
 (9, 7),
1,6,-1,Father considered this and nodded his head
2,6,-1,He waited a long time before replying
3,6,-1,' yes
4,6,-1,Bruno
5,6,-1,they are
6,6,-1,But you and I and Mother and Gretel are the most important people in our family and this is where we live now

1,6,-1,"  Ah
2,6,-1,He has got a partner
3,6,-1,I wish he had asked you
4,6,-1,"   said Mrs
5,6,-1,Allen
6,6,-1,and after a short silence
7,6,-1,she added
8,6,-1,"  he is a very agreeable young man
9,6,-1,"  Indeed he is
10,6,-1,Mrs
11,6,-1,Allen
12,6,-1,"   said Mrs
13,6,-1,Thorpe
14,6,-1,smiling complacently
15,6,-1,"  I must say it
16,6,-1,though I am his mother
17,6,-1,that there is not a more agreeable young man in the world
18,6,-1,This inapplicable answer might have been too much for the comprehension of many
19,6,-1,but it did not puzzle Mrs
20,6,-1,Allen
21,6,-1,for after only a moment 's consideration
22,6,-1,she said
23,6,-1,in a whisper to Catherine
24,6,-1,"  I dare say she thought I was speaking of her son
25,1,-1,Catherine was disappointed and vexed .
1796 3
 (1, 1),
1,4,-1,The chief anxiety was for the safety of the boats
2,6,-1,Early on the second day of warning they had been hoisted to the topmost notch of the cranes
3,6,-1,and secured as thoroughly as experience could suggest

1,6,-1,' my mother knew your father when he was just a boy of your age
2,6,-1,' said Maria after a few moments
3,6,-1,' she worked for your grandmother

5,6,-1,She arranged all the clothes for her concerts washed them

12,6,-1,Like art work
13,6,-1,every design
14,6,-1,You dont find dressmakers like that these days

16,6,-1,' she  made sure that they were all laid out and ready whenever your grandmother arrived in her dressing room before a show
17,6,-1,And after your grandmother retired
18,6,-1,of course my mother stayed friendly with her and received a small pension
19,6,-1,but times were hard then and your father offered me a job
20,6,-1,the first I had ever had
21,6,-1,A few months later my mother became very sick and she needed a lot of hospital care and your father arranged it all
22,6,-1,even though he was not obliged to
23,6,-1,He paid for it out of his own pocket because she had been a friend to his mother
24,6,-1,And he took me into his household for the same reason
25,6,-1,And when she died he paid all the expenses for her funeral too
26,6,-1,So dont you ever call your father stupid

2,6,-1,Catherine was left to the mercy of Mrs
3,6,-1,Thorpe and Mrs
4,6,-1,Allen
5,6,-1,between whom she now remained
6,5,-1,She could not help being vexed at the non-appearance of Mr Thorpe
7,6,-1,for she not only longed to be dancing
8,6,-1,but was likewise aware that
9,6,-1,as the real dignity of her situation could not be known
10,6,-1,she was sharing with the scores of other young ladies still sitting down all the discredit of wanting a partner .

7,6,-1,frustrated because they were supposed to be his three best friends for life but they had all vanished from his memory now

1234 9
 (4, 3),
1,6,-1,Sympathy and affection were great things
2,6,-1,but desire and charm must endure or one was compelled to be sadly conscious of their loss
3,6,-1,So often now he saw young girls who were quite in his mood
4,0,-1,and who were exceedingly robust and joyous
5,6,-1,It was fine
6,6,-1,advisable
7,6,-1,practical
8,6,-1,to adhere to the virtues as laid down in the current social lexicon
9,6,-1,but if you had a sickly wife .
134 8

1,6,-1,after being humbugged so many times by his procrastination
2,6,-1,I gave Sheikh Said more letters and specimens
3,6,-1,with orders to take the Tots down to the coast as soon as practicable
4,6,-1,and started once more for the north
5,6,-1,expecting very shortly to hear of Musa 's death
6,6,-1,though he promised to follow me the very next day or die in the attempt
7,6,-1,and he also said he would bring on the four men required by Suwarora
8,0,-1,for I was fully satisfied in my mind that he would have marched with me then had he had the resolution to do so at all .

4,6,-1,and enjoyed his confidence completely so much so
5,6,-1,that he said
6,6,-1,on parting with him
7,6,-1,that he did not know where he should be able to find another man to fill his post .
998 5
 (5, 4),
1,6,-1,Two events occurred that filled her mind and made the week pass quickly
2,6,-1,One was that she received an answer to her adventurous letter
3,6,-1,the other was a remarkable conversation with Miss Caroline Smith
4,6,-1,The answer to her letter was lying on her plate when she came down to breakfast
5,0,-1,and Aunt Elizabeth was watching it with an excited stare .

1894 7
 (3, 3),
1,6,-1,Straightway he sought medicine for his grief in loneliness
2,6,-1,and patiently confined the grief of his sick soul within the walls of his house
3,1,-1,But this bitter sorrow was driven out of him by the sudden arrival of Iwar
4,6,-1,who had been expelled from the kingdom
5,6,-1,For the Gauls had made him fly
6,6,-1,and had wrongfully bestowed royal power on a certain Ella
7,6,-1,the son of Hame .
1019 5
 (2, 2),(2, 3),(2, 4),
1,6,-1,He stopped and there was a long silence between them
2,1,-1,Maggie was silent because she never knew what to say when he burst into parables and divided mankind
3,6,-1,under strange names
4,6,-1,into different camps
5,6,-1,And yet this time she did know a little what he was after .

1,6,-1,The table itself was adorned with a rich tapestry cover
2,6,-1,but this was visible only at the corners

5,6,-1,with a green baize cloth considerably the worse for wear
6,6,-1,Madame d' argeles 's guests were probably not over fifty in number
7,6,-1,but they all seemed to belong to the very best society
8,6,-1,The majority of them were men of forty or thereabouts
9,6,-1,several wore decorations
10,6,-1,and two or three of the eldest were treated with marked deference
11,3,-1,Certain well-known names which Pascal overheard surprised him greatly
12,6,-1,"  What

3,6,-1,their deathless hearts Held him no worser than achilles ' self
4,0,-1,Laughing for glee the Argives gathered round The might resist less of Neoptolemus
5,6,-1,Eager for fight as wasps whose woodland bower The axe hath shaken
6,6,-1,who dart swarming forth Furious to sting the woodman .

1,6,-1,Mrs
2,6,-1,Cowperwood might die
3,6,-1,or he might run away with her at thirty-five when he had a million
4,6,-1,Some adjustment would be made
5,6,-1,somehow
6,6,-1,Nature had given her this man
7,6,-1,She relied on him implicitly
8,6,-1,When he told her that he would take care of her so that nothing evil should befall
9,0,-1,she believed him fully
10,6,-1,Such sins are the commonplaces of the confessional .

 (11, 11),
1,6,-1,That morning the princess rose earlier than she had done since she had been carried into Africa by the magician
2,6,-1,whose company she was forced to endure once a day
3,6,-1,She
4,6,-1,however
5,6,-1,treated him so harshly that he dared not live there altogether
6,6,-1,As she was dressing
7,6,-1,one of her women looked out and saw Aladdin
8,6,-1,The princess ran and opened the window
9,6,-1,and at the noise she made Aladdin looked up
10,6,-1,She called to him to come to her
11,0,-1,and great was the joy of these lovers at seeing each other again .
999 7
 (7, 6),
1,6,-1,"  Oh
2,6,-1,nothing
3,6,-1,"   said Maggie
4,6,-1,slowly
5,6,-1,Then she went on
6,6,-1,laughing :   "  i 've been asked out to tea for the first time in my life
7,4,-1,And im terribly frightened .  "
80 3
 (3, 1),
1,6,-1,In the spring of 1988 cash was running so short that he convened a meeting to decree deep spending cuts across the board
2,6,-1,When it was over
3,4,-1,Lasseter and his animation group were almost too afraid to ask Jobs about authorizing some extra money for another short .
142 11
 (7, 10),
1,6,-1,Whilst engaged in this operation
2,6,-1,Baraka
3,6,-1,accompanied by Wadimoyo ( Heart ' s-stream )
4,6,-1,another of my freeman
5,6,-1,approached me in great consternation
6,6,-1,whispering to themselves
7,4,-1,They said they had some fearful news to communicate
8,6,-1,which
9,6,-1,when I heard it
10,6,-1,they knew would deter our progress :  it was of such great moment and magnitude
11,6,-1,they thought they could not deliver it then .
1608 5
 (3, 3),
1,6,-1,Verily all The Argives had beside their ships been slain
2,6,-1,Had not achilles ' strong son on that day Withstood the host of foes and their great chief Eurypylus Came to that young hero 's side Phoenix the old
3,3,-1,and marvelling gazed on one The image of Peleides Tides of joy And grief swept over him    grief
4,6,-1,for memories Of that swift footed father   joy
5,6,-1,for sight Of such a son He for sheer gladness wept .
961 8
 (5, 4),
1,6,-1,Maggie felt as though she could see the firelight through her body
2,6,-1,and with that came also the conviction that Aunt Anne knew everything
3,6,-1,knew about Martin and the posted letter and the thoughts of escape
4,6,-1,Maggie herself was tired with the trial of her waiting day
5,1,-1,she was exhausted and was beating
6,6,-1,with all her resolve
7,6,-1,against a disappointment that hammered with a thundering noise
8,6,-1,somewhere far away in the recesses of her soul .
1429 3
 (3, 3),
1,6,-1,She came back
2,6,-1,and we started to visit
3,0,-1,I told her how happy I was that she was with us for Christmas and how I wished that Dad could have lived to see his grandchildren and to enjoy this time because he always loved Christmas so .

 (3, 3),(3, 6),
1,6,-1,He had several times taken caravans to Karague
2,6,-1,and knew all the languages well
3,1,-1,but unfortunately he afterwards proved to be what his name implied
4,6,-1,That
5,6,-1,however
6,6,-1,I could not foresee
7,6,-1,so
8,6,-1,trusting to him and good-luck
9,6,-1,I commenced making fresh enlistments of porters
10,6,-1,but they came and went in the most tantalising manner
11,6,-1,notwithstanding I offered three times the hire that any merchant could afford to give .
1824 10
 (3, 4),
1,6,-1,Two and a half hours of energetic work was required of us before we got on terms with the fleeing monsters
2,6,-1,but at last
3,0,-1,to our great joy
4,6,-1,they broke water from sounding right among us
5,6,-1,It was a considerable surprise
6,6,-1,but we were all ready
7,6,-1,and before they had spouted twice
8,6,-1,three boats were fast
9,6,-1,only myself keeping out
10,6,-1,in accordance with my instructions .
1928 13
 (9, 10),
1,6,-1,When the cage stopped
2,6,-1,I found myself on a ridge of rock
3,6,-1,and below me
4,6,-1,the chasm
5,6,-1,taking a slanting direction
6,6,-1,shot down to a considerable depth
7,6,-1,the darkness of which my lamp could not have penetrated
8,6,-1,But through it
9,0,-1,to my infinite surprise
10,6,-1,streamed upward a steady brilliant light
11,6,-1,Could it be any volcanic fire
12,6,-1,In that case
13,6,-1,surely I should have felt the heat .
65 2
 (2, 1),
1,6,-1,When Jobs made his usual threat about cutting down on France 's allocations if Gass  e didnt jack up sales projections
2,5,-1,Gass  e got angry .
1289 21
 (21, 6),(21, 7),
1,6,-1,She knew it was he
2,6,-1,without turning
3,6,-1,He came beside her
4,6,-1,and she looked up smiling
5,6,-1,the reverie evoked by Schubert partly vanishing  or melting into another mood
6,6,-1,Suddenly he bent over and pressed his lips firmly to hers
7,6,-1,His mustache thrilled her with its silky touch
8,6,-1,She stopped playing and tried to catch her breath
9,6,-1,for
10,6,-1,strong as she was
11,6,-1,it affected her breathing
12,6,-1,her heart was beating like a trip hammer
13,6,-1,She did not say
14,6,-1,"  Oh
15,6,-1,"   or
16,6,-1,"  You must n't
17,6,-1,"   but rose and walked over to a window
18,6,-1,where she lifted a curtain
19,6,-1,pretending to look out
20,6,-1,She felt as though she might faint
21,0,-1,so intensely happy was she .
2419 21
 (20, 21),
1,6,-1,This evil had been felt and lamented
2,6,-1,at least three times a day
3,6,-1,by Isabella since her residence in Bath
4,6,-1,and she was now fated to feel and lament it once more
5,6,-1,for at the very moment of coming opposite to Union Passage
6,6,-1,and within view of the two gentlemen who were proceeding through the crowds
7,6,-1,and threading the gutters of that interesting alley
8,6,-1,they were prevented crossing by the approach of a gig
9,6,-1,driven along on bad pavement by a most knowing looking coachman with all the vehemence that could most fittingly end5 the lives of himself
10,6,-1,his companion
11,6,-1,and his horse
12,6,-1,these odious gigs
13,6,-1,"   said Isabella
14,6,-1,looking up
15,6,-1,"  How I detest them
16,6,-1,But this detestation
17,6,-1,though so just
18,6,-1,was of short duration
19,6,-1,for she looked again and exclaimed
20,0,-1,"  Delightful
21,6,-1,Mr Morland and my brother
2156 4
 (1, 1),(1, 4),
1,4,-1,She was also disturbed by how filled with hatred Joel seemed at times
2,6,-1,such as the night a couple of months earlier when he had said to Mariel
3,6,-1," Were big enough now
4,6,-1,lets plan a way to kill Dad
769 25
 (20, 20),
1,6,-1,I was about to fall on my knees and thank the princess but she did not give me time
2,6,-1,Turning to the Sultan
3,6,-1,her father
4,6,-1,she said
5,6,-1,"  Sire
6,6,-1,I have gained the battle
7,6,-1,but it has cost me dear
8,6,-1,The fire has penetrated to my heart
9,6,-1,and I have only a few moments to live
10,6,-1,This would not have happened if I had only noticed the last pomegranate seed and eaten it like the rest
11,6,-1,It was the last struggle of the genius
12,6,-1,and up to that time I was quite safe
13,6,-1,But having let this chance slip I was forced to resort to fire
14,6,-1,and in spite of all his experience I showed the genius that I knew more than he did
15,6,-1,He is dead and in ashes
16,6,-1,but my own death is approaching fast
17,6,-1,"  My daughter
18,6,-1,"   cried the Sultan
19,6,-1,"  how sad is my condition
20,3,-1,I am only surprised I am alive at all
21,6,-1,The eunuch is consumed by the flames
22,6,-1,and the prince whom you have delivered has lost the sight of one eye
23,6,-1,He could say no more
24,6,-1,for sobs choked his voice
25,6,-1,and we all wept together .
624 21
 (20, 7),(20, 15),(20, 16),
1,6,-1,' im reading
2,6,-1,' said Bruno
3,6,-1,' what are you reading
4,6,-1,' she asked him
5,6,-1,and rather than answer he simply turned the cover towards her so she could see for herself
6,6,-1,She  made a raspberry sound through her lips and some of her spit landed on Bruno 's face
7,6,-1,' boring
8,6,-1,' she said in a sing-song voice
9,6,-1,' it 's not boring at all
10,6,-1,' said Bruno
11,6,-1,' it 's an adventure
12,6,-1,It 's better than dolls
13,6,-1,that 's for sure
14,6,-1,Gretel didnt rise to the bait on that one
15,6,-1,' what are you doing
16,6,-1,' she repeated
17,6,-1,irritating Bruno even further
18,6,-1,I told you
19,6,-1,im trying to read
20,5,-1,' he said in a grumpy voice
21,6,-1,' if some people would just let me . '
1991 3
 (2, 2),
1,6,-1,Indeed
2,5,-1,the Speaker 's determination to set legislative agenda and his unabashed use of personal and institutional powers to propel it have embittered a Republican minority already frustrated by its lack of influence in a House where Democrats hold sway
3,6,-1,257 to 177 .
683 3
 (1, 1),(1, 2),
1,4,-1,Thereon were seen two serpents flickering Black tongues from grimly jaws :  they seemed in act To dart
2,6,-1,but hercules ' hands to right and left   Albeit a babe 's hands   now were throttling them
3,6,-1,For awe less was his spirit .
874 8
 (5, 3),(5, 4),
1,6,-1,He was angry and helpless
2,6,-1,She seemed suddenly some one with whom it was impossible to argue
3,6,-1,He had intended to be pathetic
4,6,-1,to paint delightful pictures of uncle and niece sheltering snugly together defended by their affection against a cold and hostile London
5,1,-1,His own eyes had filled with tears as he thought of it
6,6,-1,What a hard
7,6,-1,cold-hearted girl she was
8,6,-1,Nevertheless for the moment he abandoned the subject .
657 6
 (5, 3),(5, 4),
1,6,-1,' no
2,6,-1,' said Bruno
3,6,-1,' i dont understand why we 're not allowed on the other side of it
4,6,-1,What 's so wrong with us that we cant go over there and play
5,0,-1,' Gretel stared at him and then suddenly started laughing
6,6,-1,only stopping when she saw that Bruno was being perfectly serious .
1048 11
 (6, 5),
1,6,-1,"   and
2,6,-1,"   went on Aunt Anne
3,6,-1,"  we would have forgiven that
4,6,-1,It is your deceit to ourselves that we cannot forget
5,6,-1,Day after day you were meeting him and pretending that you went to your other friends
6,1,-1,I am disappointed in you
7,6,-1,bitterly disappointed
8,6,-1,I saw from the first that you did not mean to care for us
9,6,-1,now
10,6,-1,as well
11,6,-1,you have disgraced us  "
2473 17
 (14, 14),
1,6,-1,You must not think that she 's not a good person
2,6,-1,or that she and the kids dont honestly need your help
3,6,-1,But you cannot let her take advantage of you
4,6,-1,Darling
5,6,-1,i 've seen it repeated so many times
6,6,-1,What happens with Westerners who live here for a long time is that they usually end up falling into one of two camps
7,6,-1,Half of them keep playing the tourist
8,6,-1,saying
9,6,-1,Oh
10,6,-1,those lovely Balinese
11,6,-1,so sweet
12,6,-1,so gracious
13,6,-1,"   and getting ripped off like crazy
14,1,-1,The other half get so frustrated with being ripped off all the time
15,6,-1,they start to hate the Balinese
16,6,-1,And that 's a shame
17,6,-1,because then you 've lost all these wonderful friends .  "
157 12
 (6, 7),
1,6,-1,It was given
2,6,-1,after many angry words
3,6,-1,but it was the old story over again  he would have one more wire and a cloth
4,6,-1,or else he would not allow us to proceed on the morrow
5,6,-1,My men
6,5,-1,this time really provoked
7,6,-1,said they would fight it out
8,6,-1,a king breaking his word in that way
9,6,-1,But in the end the demand had to be paid
10,6,-1,and at last
11,6,-1,at 9 P
12,6,-1,the drums beat the satisfaction .
2522 7
 (6, 7),
1,6,-1,"  Oh
2,6,-1,Aslan
3,6,-1,"   said King Peter
4,6,-1,dropping on one knee and raising the Lion 's heavy paw to his face
5,6,-1,"  im so glad
6,1,-1,And im so sorry
7,6,-1,i 've been leading them wrong ever since we started and especially yesterday morning .  "
943 7
 (4, 4),
1,6,-1,What was there then in Maggie that started up in rebellion at this unexpected declaration
2,6,-1,She had been sitting there
3,6,-1,tranquil
4,0,-1,soothed with a happy sense that her new life was developing securely for her in the way that she would have it
5,6,-1,Suddenly she was alert
6,6,-1,suspicious
7,6,-1,hostile .
921 3
 (2, 2),
1,6,-1,How fantastic these theories of fire and passion must seem
2,0,-1,he amused himself by considering
3,6,-1,to any one who knew his mother only from the outside .
1551 3
 (2, 2),
1,6,-1,And from him sprang the steed of Sthenelus
2,0,-1,Which tydeus ' son had given unto his friend In hallowed Troyland Filled with confidence In those swift feet his rider led him forth Unto the contest of the steeds that day
3,6,-1,Looking his horsemanship should surely win Renown .
2157 7
 (7, 5),
1,6,-1,A couple of weeks later
2,6,-1,he had said to her
3,6,-1," I mean it Mariel
4,6,-1,if he makes Mom cry one more time
5,6,-1,I am going to beat his brains in with my baseball bat while hes sleeping
6,6,-1,Marty had overheard what Joel said
7,4,-1,and started to have violent nightmares .
1635 2
 (1, 1),
1,0,-1,And all their souls were thrilled with lust of war :  There gathered too the Lords of the wide Sea . These in their wrath were eager to destroy The Horse of Guile and all the ships
2,6,-1,and those Fair Ilium .
508 8
 (8, 3),
1,6,-1,Bruno 's eyes opened wide and his mouth  made the shape of an O
2,6,-1,He felt his arms stretching out at his sides like they did whenever something 3d him
3,6,-1,' you dont mean we 're leaving Berlin
4,6,-1,' he asked
5,6,-1,gasping for air as he got the words out
6,6,-1,' im afraid so
7,6,-1,' said Mother
8,1,-1,nodding her head sadly .
875 5
 (2, 3),(2, 4),
1,6,-1,All this was very fascinating to Maggie who was of a practical mind with regard to the facts immediately before her but had beyond them a lively imagination
2,1,-1,Her life had been so lonely
3,6,-1,spent for the most part so far from children of her own age
4,6,-1,that she had no test of reality
5,6,-1,She did not see any reason why the Lord God should not come again and she saw every reason why her aunts should condemn her uncle .
1678 2
 (1, 1),
1,0,-1,Without making any stay at Dover The shouting and joy expressed by all is past imagination seeing that my Lord did not stir out of his barge
2,6,-1,I got into a boat and so into his barge My Lord almost transported with joy that he had done all this without any the least blur or obstruction in the world .
2423 17
 (16, 17),
1,6,-1,"  I think you must like Udolpho
2,6,-1,if you were to read it
3,6,-1,it is so very interesting
4,6,-1,"  Not I
5,6,-1,faith
6,6,-1,No
7,6,-1,if I read any
8,6,-1,it shall be Mrs
9,6,-1,Radcliffe 's
10,6,-1,her novels are amusing enough
11,6,-1,they are worth reading
12,6,-1,some fun and nature in them
13,6,-1,"  Udolpho was written by Mrs
14,6,-1,Radcliffe
15,6,-1,"   said Catherine
16,4,-1,with some hesitation
17,6,-1,from the 4 of mortifying him .
1264 14
 (10, 10),
1,6,-1,Then she put on the black silk with its glistening crimsoned silver sequins
2,6,-1,and
3,6,-1,lo
4,6,-1,it touched her
5,6,-1,She liked its coquettish drapery of tulle and silver about the hips
6,6,-1,The  "  overskirt
7,6,-1,"   which was at that time just coming into fashion
8,6,-1,though avoided by the more conservative
9,6,-1,had been adopted by Aileen with enthusiasm
10,0,-1,She thrilled a little at the rustle of this black dress
11,6,-1,and thrust her chin and nose forward to make it set right
12,6,-1,Then after having Kathleen tighten her corsets a little more
13,6,-1,she gathered the train over her arm by its train band and looked again
14,6,-1,Something was wanting .
1256 16
 (10, 8),
1,6,-1,"  Well
2,6,-1,it 's lovely now
3,6,-1,is n't it
4,6,-1,"   breathed Mrs
5,6,-1,Butler
6,6,-1,"  Sure youll be happy here
7,6,-1,Sure you will
8,6,-1,When Eddie fixed the house we 're in now
9,6,-1,says I :  ' eddie
10,0,-1,it 's almost too fine for us altogether  surely it is
11,6,-1,' and he says
12,6,-1,says ' e
13,6,-1,' norah
14,6,-1,nothing ' this side o' heavin or beyond is too good for you ' and he kissed me
15,6,-1,Now what d'ye think of that fer a big
16,6,-1,hulking ' gossoon
2496 14
 (5, 5),(5, 6),
1,6,-1,She got through her lessons as well as she could
2,6,-1,and managed to escape reprimands by being a model of deportment
3,6,-1,She was a great favorite with her mates
4,6,-1,being good tempered and possessing the happy art of pleasing without effort
5,0,-1,Her little airs and graces were much admired
6,6,-1,so were her accomplishments
7,6,-1,for besides her drawing
8,6,-1,she could play twelve tunes
9,6,-1,crochet
10,6,-1,and read French without mispronouncing more than two-thirds of the words
11,6,-1,She had a plaintive way of saying
12,6,-1,"  When Papa was rich we did so-and-so
13,6,-1,"   which was very touching
14,6,-1,and her long words were considered perfectly elegant by the girls .
1448 15
 (7, 5),
1,6,-1,I walked upstairs
2,6,-1,Jane opened the door and I said to her
3,6,-1,Sorry
4,6,-1,Jane
5,6,-1,I do not want the divorce anymore
6,6,-1,She looked at me
7,3,-1,astonished
8,6,-1,and then touched my forehead
9,6,-1,Do you have a fever
10,6,-1,She said
11,6,-1,I moved her hand off my head
12,6,-1,Sorry
13,6,-1,Jane
14,6,-1,I said
15,6,-1,I wont divorce .
1672 5
 (3, 4),
1,6,-1,I went with Captain Hayward ' to the Plymouth and Essex
2,6,-1,and did what I had to do and returned
3,0,-1,where very merry at dinner After dinner
4,6,-1,to the rest of the ships quite through the fleet Which was a very brave sight to visit all the ships
5,6,-1,and to be received with the respect and honour that I was on board them all .
1501 7
 (2, 3),
1,6,-1,The Argives thronged around
2,3,-1,And all they saw and marvelled
3,6,-1,for she seemed Like an Immortal
4,6,-1,In her armour there Upon the earth she lay
5,6,-1,and seemed the Child Of Zeus
6,6,-1,the tireless Huntress Artemis Sleeping
7,6,-1,what time her feet for wearied are With following lions with her flying shafts Over the hills far stretching .
1217 13
 (11, 10),
1,6,-1,And Mrs
2,6,-1,Cowperwood
3,6,-1,in spite of the difference in their years
4,6,-1,appeared to be a fit mate for him at this time
5,6,-1,She was once awakened
6,6,-1,and for the time being
7,6,-1,clinging
8,6,-1,responsive
9,6,-1,dreamy
10,6,-1,His mood and hers was for a baby
11,0,-1,and in a little while that happy expectation was whispered to him by her
12,6,-1,She had half fancied that her previous barrenness was due to herself
13,6,-1,and was rather 3d and delighted at the proof that it was not so .
2564 1
 (1, 1),
1,5,-1,Cornudet 
2420 23
 (12, 2),
1,6,-1,"  Good heaven
2,6,-1,' tis James
3,6,-1,"   was uttered at the same moment by Catherine
4,6,-1,and
5,6,-1,on catching the young men 's eyes
6,6,-1,the horse was immediately checked with a violence which almost threw him on his haunches
7,6,-1,and the servant having now scampered up
8,6,-1,the gentlemen jumped out
9,6,-1,and the equipage was delivered to his care
10,6,-1,Catherine
11,6,-1,by whom this meeting was wholly unexpected
12,0,-1,received her brother with the liveliest pleasure
13,6,-1,and he
14,6,-1,being of a very amiable disposition
15,6,-1,and sincerely attached to her
16,6,-1,gave every proof on his side of equal satisfaction
17,6,-1,which he could have leisure to do
18,6,-1,while the bright eyes of Miss Thorpe were incessantly challenging his notice
19,6,-1,and to her his devoir were speedily paid
20,6,-1,with a mixture of joy and embarrassment which might have informed Catherine
21,6,-1,had she been more expert in the development of other people 's feelings

8,6,-1,what your brother wants me to do
9,6,-1,He wants me to dance with him again
10,6,-1,though I tell him that it is a most improper thing

12,6,-1,' said the Duchess
13,6,-1,chop off her head
14,4,-1,' Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook
15,6,-1,to see if she meant to take the hint
16,6,-1,but the cook was busily stirring the soup
17,6,-1,and seemed not to be listening
18,6,-1,so she went on again :   Twenty-four hours
19,6,-1,I THINK
20,6,-1,or is it twelve
21,6,-1,I ' Oh
22,6,-1,dont bother ME
23,6,-1,' said the Duchess

25,6,-1,' And with that she began nursing her child again
26,6,-1,singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so
27,6,-1,and giving it a violent shake at the end of every line :   Speak roughly to your little boy
28,6,-1,And beat him when he sneezes :  He only does it to annoy

7,6,-1,But look at you

11,6,-1,who had never before seen their mother so familiarly handled .

3,6,-1,nor the servant 's
4,6,-1,she would believe no assurance of it founded on reason or reality
5,6,-1,till Morland produced his watch
6,6,-1,and ascertained the fact
7,6,-1,to have doubted a moment longer then would have been equally inconceivable
8,6,-1,incredible
9,6,-1,and impossible
10,6,-1,and she could only protest
11,6,-1,over and over again
12,6,-1,that no two hours and a half had ever gone off so swiftly before
13,6,-1,as Catherine was called on to confirm
14,6,-1,Catherine could not tell a falsehood even to please Isabella
15,1,-1,but the latter was spared the misery of her friend 's dissenting voice
16,6,-1,by not waiting for her answer .

1,6,-1,Either the well was very deep
2,6,-1,or she fell very slowly
3,6,-1,for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next  .  First
4,6,-1,she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to
5,6,-1,but it was too dark to see anything
6,6,-1,then she looked at the sides of the well
7,6,-1,and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book shelves
8,6,-1,here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs . She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed
9,6,-1,it was labelled  ' ORANGE MARMALADE '
10,4,-1,but to her great disappointment it was empty :  she did not like to drop the jar for 4 of killing somebody
11,6,-1,so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it  Well

13,6,-1,after such a fall as this
14,6,-1,I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs
15,6,-1,How brave they 'll all think me at home

1,6,-1,"  But what can I do
2,6,-1,Frank
3,6,-1,"   he pleaded
4,6,-1,weakly
5,6,-1,"  I cant go against Mollenhauer
6,6,-1,They can prosecute me if I do that
7,6,-1,They can do it
8,6,-1,anyhow
9,6,-1,I cant do that
10,6,-1,im not strong enough
11,6,-1,If they didnt know
12,6,-1,if you had not told them
13,6,-1,it might be different
14,6,-1,but this way  "   He shook his head sadly
15,1,-1,his gray eyes filled with a pale distress .
1720 9
 (5, 5),(5, 6),
1,6,-1,I had hardly done reckoning them up when two or three bustling men came out and shepherded us all energetically into a long
2,6,-1,low room
3,6,-1,where some form of agreement was read out to us
4,6,-1,Sailors are naturally and usually careless about the nature of the  "  articles "   they sign
5,4,-1,their chief anxiety being to get to sea
6,6,-1,and under somebody 's charge
7,6,-1,But had I been ever so anxious to know what I was going to sign this time
8,6,-1,I could not
9,6,-1,for the language might as well have been Chinese for all I understood of it .
1974 13
 (7, 5),(7, 6),
1,6,-1,' does the marching go on for long
2,6,-1,' he whispered because he was beginning to feel quite hungry now
3,6,-1,' i dont think so
4,6,-1,' said Shmuel
5,6,-1,' i never see the people after they 've gone on a march
6,6,-1,But I would n't imagine it does
7,3,-1,Bruno frowned
8,6,-1,He looked up at the sky
9,6,-1,and as he did so there was another loud sound
10,6,-1,this time the sound of thunder overhead
11,6,-1,and just as quickly the sky seemed to grow even darker
12,6,-1,almost black
13,6,-1,and rain poured down even more heavily than it had in the morning .
2412 16
 (15, 14),
1,6,-1,"  Yes
2,6,-1,that I do
3,6,-1,There is nothing I would not do for those who are really my friends
4,6,-1,I have no notion of loving people by halves
5,6,-1,it is not my nature
6,6,-1,My attachments are always excessively strong
7,6,-1,I told Captain Hunt at one of our assemblies this winter that if he was to tease me all night
8,6,-1,I would not dance with him
9,6,-1,unless he would allow Miss Andrews to be as beautiful as an angel
10,6,-1,The men think us incapable of real friendship
11,6,-1,you know
12,6,-1,and I am determined to show them the difference
13,6,-1,Now
14,6,-1,if I were to hear anybody speak slightingly of you
15,5,-1,I should fire up in a moment :  but that is not at all likely
16,6,-1,for you are just the kind of girl to be a great favourite with the men .  "
2158 6
 (2, 1),
1,6,-1,One night Mariel woke up out of her sleep to hear her parents fighting in their bedroom
2,2,-1," Im sick of this
3,6,-1,Kaleigh
4,6,-1,"  her father was yelling
5,6,-1," its been weeks
6,6,-1,I dont want to hear any more of your fucking excuses about how your head aches or youre too tired .
178 12
 (4, 4),
1,6,-1,but Ntalo wont be done
2,6,-1,so retorts by saying
3,6,-1,"  Sangizo
4,2,-1,you may laugh at me because I am an orphan
5,6,-1,but what are you
6,6,-1,you are a savage a Mshezi
7,6,-1,you come from the Mashenzi
8,6,-1,and you wear skins
9,6,-1,not cloths
10,6,-1,as men do
11,6,-1,so hold your impudent tongue "
12,6,-1,and the camp pealed with merry boisterous laughter again .

 (5, 5),
1,6,-1,' dear SIR
2,6,-1,' you wrote to your London correspondent ' i send you three thousand francs
3,6,-1,in addition to the five thousand for the regular quarterly payment
4,6,-1,Forward the money without delay
5,4,-1,I fear the poor boy is greatly annoyed by his creditors
6,6,-1,Yesterday I had the happiness of seeing him in the Rue de Helder
7,6,-1,and I found him looking pale and careworn
8,6,-1,When you send him this money
9,6,-1,forward at the same time a letter of fatherly advice
10,6,-1,It is true
11,6,-1,he ought to work and win an honorable position for himself
12,6,-1,but think of the dangers and temptation that beset him
13,6,-1,alone and friendless
14,6,-1,in this corrupt city . '
650 8
 (4, 7),
1,6,-1,' shmuel
2,6,-1,' he said
3,6,-1,running towards him and sitting down
4,1,-1,almost crying with relief and regret
5,6,-1,' im so sorry
6,6,-1,Shmuel
7,6,-1,I dont know why I did it
8,6,-1,Say youll forgive me . '

 (29, 29),
1,6,-1,Idiot
2,6,-1,' said the Queen
3,6,-1,tossing her head impatiently
4,6,-1,and
5,6,-1,turning to Alice
6,6,-1,she went on
7,6,-1,What 's your name
8,6,-1,child
9,6,-1,'  My name is Alice
10,6,-1,so please your Majesty
11,6,-1,' said Alice very politely
12,6,-1,but she added
13,6,-1,to herself
14,6,-1,Why
15,6,-1,theyre only a pack of cards
16,6,-1,after allI need n't be afraid of them
17,6,-1,'  And who are THESE
18,6,-1,' said the Queen
19,6,-1,pointing to the three gardeners who were lying round the rose tree
20,6,-1,for
21,6,-1,you see
22,6,-1,as they were lying on their faces
23,6,-1,and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack
24,6,-1,she could not tell whether they were gardeners
25,6,-1,or soldiers
26,6,-1,or courtiers
27,6,-1,or three of her own children How should I know
28,6,-1,' said Alice
29,3,-1,3d at her own courage It 's no business of MINE
30,6,-1,The Queen turned crimson with fury
31,6,-1,and
32,6,-1,after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast
33,6,-1,screamed  Off with her head
34,6,-1,Off '  Nonsense
35,6,-1,' said Alice
36,6,-1,very loudly and decidedly
37,6,-1,and the Queen was silent  .  The King laid his hand upon her arm
38,6,-1,and timidly said  Consider
39,6,-1,my dear :  she is only a child
40,6,-1,' The Queen turned angrily away from him
41,6,-1,and said to the Knave  Turn them over
977 12
 (3, 3),

2,6,-1,i 've got my three hundred pounds and I dont think I want to be religious

5,6,-1,im afraid
6,6,-1,I know im very careless
7,6,-1,I do want to be better
8,6,-1,and that 's all the more reason
9,6,-1,perhaps
10,6,-1,why I should go out and earn my own living
11,6,-1,i 'd learn more quickly then
12,6,-1,But I do love you and Aunt Elizabeth
965 13
 (10, 3),(10, 5),(10, 6),(10, 7),(10, 8),(10, 9),
1,6,-1,There seemed to be more of the servant class
2,6,-1,rather they were older women with serious rapt expressions and very silent
3,6,-1,There were men too
4,6,-1,to-night
5,6,-1,four or five gathered together inside the passage
6,6,-1,standing gravely
7,6,-1,without a word
8,6,-1,not moving
9,6,-1,like statues
10,4,-1,Maggie was frightened
11,6,-1,She felt like a spy in an enemy 's camp
12,6,-1,and a spy waiting for an inevitable detection
13,6,-1,with no hope of securing any news .
505 9
 (3, 7),(3, 8),
1,6,-1,' oh my
2,6,-1,' said Mother with a laugh
3,1,-1,although it was a strange kind of laugh because she didnt look happy and turned away from Bruno as if she didnt want him to see her face
4,6,-1,' yes
5,6,-1,Bruno
6,6,-1,' she said
7,6,-1,' it 's more than a mile away
8,6,-1,Quite a lot more than that
9,6,-1,in fact . '
532 17
 (17, 5),
1,6,-1,' look over there
2,6,-1,' said Bruno
3,6,-1,and Gretel followed the direction of the finger he was pointing and saw
4,6,-1,emerging from a hut in the distance
5,6,-1,a group of children huddled together and being shouted at by a group of soldiers
6,6,-1,The more they were shouted at
7,6,-1,the closer they huddled together
8,6,-1,but then one of the soldiers lunged towards them and they separated and seemed to do what he had wanted them to do all along
9,6,-1,which was to stand in a single line
10,6,-1,When they did
11,6,-1,the soldiers all started to laugh and applaud them
12,6,-1,' it must be some sort of rehearsal
13,6,-1,' suggested Gretel
14,6,-1,ignoring the fact that some of the children
15,6,-1,even some of the older ones
16,6,-1,even the ones as grown up as her
17,1,-1,looked as if they were crying .
100 7
 (2, 2),
1,6,-1,Bewkes didnt agree with any of those premises
2,0,-1,He said he was happy for Apple to sell digital subscriptions for Time Inc
3,6,-1,Apple 's 30% take was not the problem
4,6,-1,im telling you right now
5,6,-1,if you sell a sub for us
6,6,-1,you can have 30%
7,6,-1,Bewkes told him .
86 6
 (2, 2),
1,6,-1,On occasion this could backfire
2,4,-1,such as when Jobs and Ive insisted on using a solid piece of brushed aluminum for the edge of the iPhone 4 even when the engineers worried that it would compromise the antenna
3,6,-1,But usually the distinctiveness of its designs for the iMac
4,6,-1,the iPod
5,6,-1,the iPhone
6,6,-1,and the iPad would set Apple apart and lead to its triumphs in the years after Jobs returned .
27 4
 (3, 2),
1,6,-1,A year after Lisa was born
2,6,-1,Jobs agreed to take a paternity test
3,3,-1,Brennan 's family was surprised
4,6,-1,but Jobs knew that Apple would soon be going public and he decided it was best to get the issue resolved .
2812 5
 (4, 2),
1,6,-1,About halfway through my glass of wine
2,6,-1,my head starts feeling foggy
3,6,-1,so I change to water instead
4,1,-1,I dont like the feeling and hope it wears off soon
5,6,-1,How Haymitch can stand walking around like this full-time is a mystery .
872 11
 (11, 3),(11, 4),(11, 5),(11, 6),
1,6,-1,She would have loved him had he allowed her
2,6,-1,and because he did not she bore him no grudge
3,6,-1,She had always regarded her life
4,6,-1,sterile and unprofitable as it was
5,6,-1,with humour until now when
6,6,-1,like a discarded dress
7,6,-1,it had slipped behind her
8,6,-1,She did not see it
9,6,-1,even now
10,6,-1,with bitterness
11,0,-1,there was no bitterness for anything in her character .
2045 1

1,0,-1,The boys amused themselves by sliding down the banister .
974 5
 (2, 2),
1,6,-1,She talked on and on
2,1,-1,sometimes her sentences were confused and unfinished
3,6,-1,sometimes they seemed to Maggie to have no meaning
4,6,-1,once or twice the voice dropped so low that Maggie did not catch the words
5,6,-1,but always there was especial urgency behind the carelessness as though every word were being spoken for a listener 's benefit a listener who sat perhaps with pencil and notebook somewhere in the dark behind them .
64 7
 (6, 5),
1,6,-1,He was just completely obnoxious and thinking he could get away with anything
2,6,-1,she recalled
3,6,-1,In Paris she had arranged a formal dinner with French software developers
4,6,-1,but Jobs suddenly decided he didnt want to go
5,6,-1,Instead he shut the car door on Hoffman and told her he was going to see the poster artist Folon instead
6,5,-1,The developers were so pissed off they would n't shake our hands
7,6,-1,she said .
2398 9
 (3, 1),
1,6,-1,Mrs Allen had no similar information to give
2,6,-1,no similar triumphs to press on the unwilling and unbelieving ear of her friend
3,1,-1,and was forced to sit and appear to listen to all these maternal effusions
4,6,-1,consoling herself
5,6,-1,however
6,6,-1,with the discovery
7,6,-1,which her keen eye soon made
8,6,-1,that the lace on Mrs
9,6,-1,Thorpe 's pelisse was not half so handsome as that on her own .
862 4
 (3, 3),
1,6,-1,Anne the kitchen maid scoured the pans
2,6,-1,her bony frame seemed to rattle as she scrubbed with her red hands
3,0,-1,she was happy because she was hungry and there would be a beef steak pudding for dinner
4,6,-1,She sang to herself as she worked .
1203 13
 (12, 13),
1,6,-1,In spite of her 4s and her uncertainty
2,6,-1,Lillian Semple accepted his attentions and interest because
3,6,-1,equally in spite of herself
4,6,-1,she was drawn to him
5,6,-1,One night
6,6,-1,when she was going to bed
7,6,-1,she stopped in front of her dressing table and looked at her face and her bare neck and arms
8,6,-1,They were very pretty
9,6,-1,A subtle something came over her as she surveyed her long
10,6,-1,peculiarly shaded hair
11,6,-1,She thought of young Cowperwood
12,1,-1,and then was chilled and shamed by the vision of the late Mr
13,6,-1,Semple and the force and quality of public opinion .
523 9
 (6, 1),
1,6,-1,' i dont see what else there is to do other than that
2,6,-1,' said Bruno sadly
3,6,-1,' i dont even think there 's going to be anyone to play with other than Gretel
4,6,-1,and what fun is that after all
5,6,-1,She 's a Hopeless Case
6,1,-1,He felt as if he was about to cry again but stopped himself
7,6,-1,not wanting to look like a baby in front of Maria
8,6,-1,He looked around the room without fully lifting his eyes up from the ground
9,6,-1,trying to see whether there was anything of interest to be found .
1645 7
 (2, 2),
1,6,-1,Man after man he slew like some fierce beast
2,4,-1,And foes shrank from the terrible rage that burned On his life 's verge
3,6,-1,nor reeked of imminent doom
4,6,-1,Yea
5,6,-1,peerless deeds in that fight had he done
6,6,-1,Had not his hands grown weary
7,6,-1,his spear head Bent utterly .
247 6
 (3, 3),
1,6,-1,He was in all the greater haste as it was Sunday
2,6,-1,Fortunat was in the habit of passing these days in the country
3,4,-1,and Chupin feared he might fail to see him if he was not expeditious in his movements
4,6,-1,And while running to the Place de la Bourse
5,6,-1,he carefully prepared the story he meant to relate
6,6,-1,deeply impressed by the wisdom of the popular maxim which says :   "  It is not always well to tell the whole truth .  "
188 17
 (6, 6),(17, 6),
1,6,-1,We reached the Cowes by torchlight at 9 p
2,6,-1,when the king had a picnic dinner with me
3,6,-1,turned in with his women in great comfort
4,6,-1,and sent me off to a dreary hut
5,6,-1,where I had to sleep upon a grass strew floor
6,3,-1,I was surprised we had to walk so far
7,6,-1,when
8,6,-1,by appearance
9,6,-1,we might have boated it from the head of the creek all the way down
10,6,-1,but
11,6,-1,on inquiry
12,6,-1,was informed of the swampy nature of the ground at the head of the creek precluded any approach to the clear water there
13,6,-1,and hence the long overland journey
14,6,-1,which
15,6,-1,though fatiguing to the unfortunate women
16,6,-1,who had to trot the whole way behind Mtesa 's four mile an hour strides
17,3,-1,was very amusing .
1523 3
 (1, 1),
1,1,-1,And mourned with these the Pleiads
2,6,-1,Echoed round far stretching mountains
3,6,-1,and aesopus ' stream .
1117 10
 (7, 7),
1,6,-1,His whole nature was easy
2,6,-1,genial
3,6,-1,and
4,6,-1,above all
5,6,-1,lazy
6,6,-1,He liked to be liked
7,3,-1,and she Was often astonished at the pleasure with which he received compliments
8,6,-1,He had a conceit of himself
9,6,-1,not as a man but as a clergyman
10,6,-1,and she knew that nothing pleased him so much as when people praised his  "  good natured humanity .
62 5
 (3, 2),
1,6,-1,After Jobs talked about the just-in-time production schedules
2,6,-1,she asked about overtime pay
3,5,-1,He was annoyed
4,6,-1,so he described how automation helped him keep down labor costs
5,6,-1,a subject he knew would not delight her .
2152 1
 (1, 1),
1,4,-1,Mariel dreaded each fight that would break out between her parents .

1,6,-1,' he 's not going to mind
2,6,-1,' said Bruno
3,6,-1,who was confused by how anxious Shmuel seemed
4,6,-1,' it 's only food
5,6,-1,' i cant
6,6,-1,' said Shmuel
7,1,-1,shaking his head and looking as if he was going to cry
8,6,-1,' he 'll come back
9,6,-1,I know he will
10,6,-1,' he continued
11,6,-1,his sentences running quickly together
12,6,-1,' i should have eaten them when you offered them

2,0,-1,consent to fight :  thou must needs grant one thing or the other We wish either to die or to have our prayers beard Something   sorrow if not joy   we will get from thee Frode will be better pleased to hear of our slaughter than of our repulse
3,6,-1,Without another word
4,6,-1,he threatened to aim a blow at the king 's throat with his sword The king replied that it was unseemly for the royal majesty to meet an inferior in rank in level combat
5,6,-1,and unfit that those of unequal station should fight as equals .
841 5
 (4, 3),
1,6,-1,A man from Ruanda then told us of the Wilyanwantu ( men eaters )
2,6,-1,who disdained all food but human flesh
3,6,-1,and Rumanika confirmed the statement
4,2,-1,Though I felt very sceptical about it
5,6,-1,I could not help thinking it a curious coincidence that the position they were said to occupy agreed with Petherick 's Nyam Nyams ( men eaters ) .
726 4
 (4, 3),
1,6,-1,Jony and Steve were riffing on their design problem
2,6,-1,then Jony asked

1,6,-1,"  Princess
2,6,-1,"   I replied
3,6,-1,"  I see it is only fear of the genius that makes you act like this
4,6,-1,For myself
5,4,-1,I dread him so little that I mean to break his talisman in pieces
6,6,-1,Awful though you think him
7,6,-1,he shall feel the weight of my arm
8,6,-1,and I herewith take a solemn vow to stamp out the whole race .  "

1,6,-1,' we lived there for some more months
2,6,-1,' continued Shmuel
3,6,-1,' all of us in that one room
4,2,-1,There was one small window in it but I didnt like to look out of it because then I would see the wall and I hated the wall because our real home was on the other side of it
5,6,-1,And this part of town was the bad part because it was always noisy and it was impossible to sleep
6,6,-1,And I hated Luka
7,6,-1,who was the boy who kept hitting me even when I did nothing wrong . '
960 11

1,6,-1,She loved Martin and Martin loved her
2,6,-1,Soon Martin would marry her and they would go away
3,6,-1,Her aunt would be sorry of course
4,6,-1,and his father
5,6,-1,perhaps
6,6,-1,would be angry
7,5,-1,but the sorrow and 5 would be only for a little while
8,6,-1,Then Martin and she would live happily together always happily because they were both sensible people
9,6,-1,and her own standard of fidelity and trust was
10,6,-1,she supposed
11,6,-1,also his .

1,6,-1,' kinsman
2,6,-1,' thought Malcolm
3,6,-1,' do all wandering Stewarts claim kin to the blood royal
4,6,-1,' but then
5,6,-1,as he looked at Sir James 's stately head
6,6,-1,he felt that no assumption could be unbecoming in one of such a presence
7,6,-1,and so kind to himself
8,6,-1,and
9,6,-1,ashamed of the moment 's petulance
10,6,-1,dismounted
11,6,-1,and
12,6,-1,as John said
13,6,-1,' this is the way to our noon meat
14,6,-1,' he let himself be conducted through the trees to a glade
15,6,-1,sheltered from the wind
16,6,-1,where a Lenten though not unsavoury meal of bread
17,6,-1,dried fish
18,6,-1,and eggs was laid out on the grass
19,6,-1,in a bright warm sunshine
20,6,-1,and Hal
21,6,-1,declaring himself to have a hunter 's appetite
22,6,-1,and that he knew Jamie had been starved in Scotland
23,6,-1,and was as lean as a greyhound
24,6,-1,seated himself on the grass
25,3,-1,and to Malcolm 's extreme 3
26,6,-1,not to say 2
27,6,-1,was served by Lord Marmion on the knee and with doffed cap .
1006 4
 (2, 3),(4, 3),
1,6,-1,Maggie told her about the visit
2,3,-1,Aunt Anne looked at her curiously
3,6,-1,She seemed so weak and frail that Maggie suddenly felt warm maternal love
4,3,-1,Rather shyly she put her hand upon her aunt 's :   "  I wont go away until you 're better  "
429 8
 (4, 3),
1,6,-1,She almost fainted
2,6,-1,after bearing adversity so bravely
3,6,-1,this 0 proved too much for her
4,3,-1,She could scarcely believe it
5,6,-1,A long explanation was necessary to convince her of the truth
6,6,-1,and then big tears
7,6,-1,tears of joy this time
8,6,-1,gushed from her eyes .
2451 9
 (2, 2),
1,6,-1,She entered the rooms on Thursday evening with feelings very different from what had attended her thither the Monday before
2,0,-1,She had then been exulting in her engagement to Thorpe
3,6,-1,and was now chiefly anxious to avoid his sight
4,6,-1,lest he should engage her again

5,6,-1,and when tea was over
6,6,-1,glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies
7,6,-1,Mr Collins readily assented
8,6,-1,and a book was produced
9,6,-1,but on beholding it ( for every thing announced it to be from a circulating library )
10,4,-1,he started back
11,6,-1,and begging pardon
12,6,-1,protested that he never read novels
13,6,-1,Kitty stared at him
14,6,-1,and Lydia exclaimed .
2189 1
 (1, 1),
1,2,-1,Mariel would express upset that her father had punished Marty too harshly and that he would call Joel a  " spaz "  when they played whiffle ball .
1504 6
 (1, 1),
1,4,-1,Then ares ' heart was thrilled with grief and rage For his child slain
2,6,-1,raight from Olympus down He darted
3,6,-1,swift and bright as thunderbolt Terribly flashing from the mighty hand Of Zeus
4,6,-1,far leaping over the trackless sea
5,6,-1,Or flaming over the land
6,6,-1,while shuddereth All wide Olympus as it passeth by .
221 17
 (10, 11),(10, 12),
1,6,-1,Excitement keyed us high
2,6,-1,we reached the shade
3,6,-1,plunged into it
4,6,-1,and presently came out staring at the bastioned corners of a fort which rose from the centre of a clearing
5,6,-1,It had once defended the place
6,6,-1,but now stood abandoned and dismantled
7,6,-1,Beyond it
8,6,-1,at the edge of the bluff
9,6,-1,we halted
10,3,-1,astonished
11,6,-1,The sun was falling in the west
12,6,-1,and below us was the goal for the sight of which we had suffered so much
13,6,-1,At our feet
14,6,-1,across the wooded bottom
15,6,-1,was the Kaskaskia River
16,6,-1,and beyond
17,6,-1,the peaceful little French village with its low houses and orchards and gardens colored by the touch of the evening light .
873 4
 (1, 3),
1,1,-1,"  You wont be happy there
2,6,-1,my dear
3,6,-1,with all their religion and the rest of it and two old maids
4,6,-1,youll see no life at all .  "
2071 28
 (8, 6),(8, 7),
1,6,-1,Off with her head
2,6,-1,' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice . Nobody moved Who cares for you
3,6,-1,' said Alice
4,6,-1,( she had grown to her full size by this time
5,6,-1,you 're nothing but a pack of cards
6,6,-1,' At this the whole pack rose up into the air
7,6,-1,and came flying down upon her :  she gave a little scream
8,4,-1,half of fright and half of 5
9,6,-1,and tried to beat them off
10,6,-1,and found herself lying on the bank
11,6,-1,with her head in the lap of her sister
12,6,-1,who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face Wake up
13,6,-1,Alice dear
14,6,-1,' said her sister
15,6,-1,Why
16,6,-1,what a long sleep you 've had
17,6,-1,'  Oh
18,6,-1,i 've had such a curious dream
19,6,-1,' said Alice
20,6,-1,and she told her sister
21,6,-1,as well as she could remember them
22,6,-1,all these strange Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about
23,6,-1,and when she had finished
24,6,-1,her sister kissed her
25,6,-1,and said
26,6,-1,It WAS a curious dream
27,6,-1,dear
28,6,-1,certainly :  but now run in to your tea
2678 2
 (2, 1),
1,6,-1,"  Do not you want to know who has taken it
2,2,-1,"   cried his wife impatiently .
2433 13
 (2, 1),
1,6,-1,From this state of humiliation
2,5,-1,she was roused
3,6,-1,at the end of ten minutes
4,6,-1,to a more pleasant feeling
5,6,-1,by seeing
6,6,-1,not Mr Thorpe
7,6,-1,but Mr Tilney
8,6,-1,within three yards of the place where they sat
9,6,-1,he seemed to be moving that way
10,6,-1,but he did not see her
11,6,-1,and therefore the smile and the blush
12,6,-1,which his sudden reappearance raised in Catherine
13,6,-1,passed away without sullying her heroic importance .
1578 1
 (1, 1),
1,1,-1,This track the Blest Gods may alone behold . So died a host on either side that warred Over Machaon and Aglaia 's son . But at the last through desperate wrestle of fight The Danaans rescued them :  yet few were they Which bare them to the ships .
1283 8
 (4, 2),
1,6,-1,At the same time
2,6,-1,in contemplating his wife in connection with all this
3,6,-1,he had many qualms
4,2,-1,some emotional
5,6,-1,some financial
6,6,-1,While she had yielded to his youthful enthusiasm for her after her husband 's death
7,6,-1,he had only since learned that she was a natural conservator of public morals the cold purity of the snowdrift in so far as the world might see
8,6,-1,combined at times with the murky mood of the wanton .
1069 5
 (3, 3),
1,6,-1,"  Maggie
2,6,-1,"   she said
3,1,-1,"  if i 've been harsh to you during these weeks im sorry
4,6,-1,i 've done what I thought my duty
5,6,-1,but I would n't wish on this night that we should have any unkindness in our hearts towards one another .  "
1450 6
 (4, 6),
1,6,-1,An old woman and 10 years old boy with school bag on his back were waiting for me
2,6,-1,I treated the old lady first
3,6,-1,and then asked the boy to get in
4,4,-1,He was pale and shaking
5,6,-1,He sat on the dental chair and pointed inside his mouth
6,6,-1,and said  "  this is very painful "   .
495 4
 (2, 2),
1,6,-1,Fortunat did not know what to reply
2,3,-1,The question took him completely by surprise
3,6,-1,and feeling that his answer would have a very considerable influence upon what might follow
4,6,-1,he hesitated .
501 14
 (12, 3),(12, 8),(12, 9),(12, 10),(12, 11),
1,6,-1,' what is
2,6,-1,' he asked
3,6,-1,' am I being sent away
4,6,-1,'	' no
5,6,-1,not just you
6,6,-1,' she said
7,6,-1,looking as if she might smile for a moment but thinking better of it
8,6,-1,We all are
9,6,-1,Your father and I
10,6,-1,Gretel and you
11,6,-1,All four of us
12,1,-1,Bruno thought about this and frowned
13,6,-1,He wasnt particularly bothered if Gretel was being sent away because she was a Hopeless Case and caused nothing but trouble for him
14,6,-1,But it seemed a little unfair that they all had to go with her .
1499 8
 (5, 5),
1,6,-1,As when on the wide sea
2,6,-1,' neath buffetings Of storm blasts
3,6,-1,castaways whose ship is wrecked Escape
4,6,-1,a remnant of a crew
5,1,-1,for spent With desperate conflict with the cruel sea :  Late and at last appears the land hard by
6,6,-1,Appears a city :  faint and weary limbed With that grim struggle
7,6,-1,through the surf they strain To land
8,6,-1,sore grieving for the good ship lost .
2492 14
 (7, 8),
1,6,-1,The old lady would n't speak to them for a time
2,6,-1,but happening to meet Jo at a friend 's
3,6,-1,something in her comical face and blunt manners struck the old lady 's fancy
4,6,-1,and she proposed to take her for a companion
5,6,-1,This did not suit Jo at all
6,6,-1,but she accepted the place since nothing better appeared and
7,3,-1,to every one 's 3
8,6,-1,got on remarkably well with her irascible relative
9,6,-1,There was an occasional tempest
10,6,-1,and once Jo marched home
11,6,-1,declaring she could n't bear it longer
12,6,-1,but Aunt March always cleared up quickly
13,6,-1,and sent for her to come back again with such urgency that she could not refuse
14,6,-1,for in her heart she rather liked the peppery old lady .
2375 12
 (11, 9),
1,6,-1,Mr Allen
2,6,-1,who owned the chief of the property about Fullerton
3,6,-1,the village in Wiltshire where the Morlands lived
4,6,-1,was ordered to Bath for the benefit of a gouty constitution   and his lady
5,6,-1,a good-humoured woman
6,6,-1,fond of Miss Morland
7,6,-1,and probably aware that if adventures will not befall a young lady in her own village
8,6,-1,she must seek them abroad
9,6,-1,invited her to go with them
10,6,-1,Mr and Mrs
11,0,-1,Morland were all compliance
12,6,-1,and Catherine all 0 .
1002 7
 (5, 3),
1,6,-1,Well
2,6,-1,anyway
3,6,-1,Miss Avies is the strongest of the lot really
4,6,-1,i 'd back her against anybody
5,4,-1,im terrified of her myself
6,6,-1,I tell you frankly
7,6,-1,She 'd wring any one 's neck for twopence .
161 5
 (3, 3),
1,6,-1,The flatterers said
2,6,-1,"  It is as clear as possible
3,0,-1,God gave the thunderbolt to Dagaro as a sign he was pleased with him and his rule
4,6,-1,but when he found two brothers contending
5,6,-1,he withdrew it to show their conduct was wicked .  "
649 7
 (2, 3),(2, 4),
1,6,-1,Bruno nodded and turned round and left the kitchen without looking back
2,1,-1,His stomach churned inside him and he thought for a moment that he was going to be sick
3,6,-1,He had never felt so ashamed in his life
4,6,-1,he had never imagined that he could behave so cruelly
5,6,-1,He wondered how a boy who thought he was a good person really could act in such a cowardly way towards a friend
6,6,-1,He sat in the living room for several hours but could n't concentrate on his book and didnt dare to go back to the kitchen until later that evening
7,6,-1,when Lieutenant Kotler had already come back and collected Shmuel and taken him away again .
1349 4
 (4, 3),
1,6,-1,Finally
2,6,-1,in the middle of the night
3,6,-1,our own doctor came in and told us that it was fine to take Noah home
4,0,-1,We couldnt pack fast enough
1505 4
 (2, 2),
1,6,-1,Yet still Many a wild thought surged through ares ' soul
2,4,-1,Urging him now to dread the terrible threat Of cronos ' wrathful Son
3,6,-1,and to return Heavenward
4,6,-1,and now to reck not of his Sire .
916 4
 (2, 2),
1,6,-1,But behind the facility and easy flow of his words Maggie fancied that she detected some urgent insistence that came from the man 's very heart
2,0,-1,She was moved by that as though he were saying to her personally
3,6,-1,"  dont heed these outward words of mine
4,6,-1,But listen to me myself .
2653 1
 (1, 1),
1,0,-1,After some time  we saw lights on the Illinois side of the river and Jim got very excited .  He thought it was Cairo
644 8
 (8, 6),
1,6,-1,' no
2,6,-1,if he comes back ' said Shmuel
3,6,-1,shaking his head quickly and looking back and forth towards the door
4,6,-1,' if who comes back
5,6,-1,You dont mean Lieutenant Kotler
6,6,-1,im just supposed to be cleaning the glasses
7,6,-1,' he said
8,1,-1,looking at the bowl of water in front of him in despair and then looking back at the slices of chicken that Bruno held out to him .
1070 2
 (1, 1),
1,0,-1,She was now so touched by the pathos of his helplessness that she could think of nothing else and longed to go to him and comfort him
2,6,-1,Time stole on and it was now ten minutes to twelve .
880 6
 (4, 4),
1,6,-1,Her uncle
2,6,-1,watching her surreptitiously
3,6,-1,wondered of what she was thinking
4,3,-1,Her determined treatment of him that afternoon continued to 3 him
5,6,-1,She certainly ought to make her way in the world
6,6,-1,but what a pity that she was so plain .
1973 7
 (5, 4),
1,6,-1,' ssh
2,6,-1,' said Shmuel
3,6,-1,putting a finger to his lips
4,6,-1,dont say anything or they get angry
5,3,-1,Bruno frowned but was relieved that all the people in striped pyjamas from this part of the camp were gathering together now
6,6,-1,most of them being pushed together by the soldiers
7,6,-1,so that he and Shmuel were hidden in the centre of them and could n't be seen .
1688 3
 (2, 2),
1,6,-1,In the afternoon I went to White Hall
2,3,-1,where I was 3d with the news of a plot against the King 's person and my Lord Monk 's
3,6,-1,and that since last night there were about forty taken up on suspicion .
593 7
 (7, 5),(7, 6),(7, 7),
1,6,-1,Grandfather had spent his entire life running a restaurant in the centre of town
2,6,-1,and one of his employees was the father of Bruno 's friend Martin who worked there as a chef
3,6,-1,Although Grandfather no longer cooked or waited on tables in the restaurant himself
4,6,-1,he spent most of his days there
5,6,-1,sitting at the bar in the afternoon talking to the customers
6,6,-1,eating his meals there in the evening and staying until closing time
7,0,-1,laughing with his friends .
159 13
 (1, 1),
1,0,-1,Just then Bombay returned flushed with the excitement of a great success
2,6,-1,He had been in Masudi 's camp
3,6,-1,and had delivered my message to Insangez
4,6,-1,Asudi
5,6,-1,he said
6,6,-1,had been there a fortnight unable to settle his hongo
7,6,-1,for the great Mkama had not deigned to see him
8,6,-1,though the Arab had been daily to his palace requesting an interview
9,6,-1,"  Well
10,6,-1,"   I said
11,6,-1,"  that is all very interesting
12,6,-1,but what next
13,6,-1,will the big king see us
2629 4
 (4, 4),
1,6,-1,All the warehouse workers were coarse 
2,6,-1,who were used to working in dirty conditions for long hours
3,6,-1,No words can describe the horror I felt 
4,2,-1,I was deeply ashamed at having such a job and I was also afraid that I would forget everything I had learnt from my mother and my teachers .
1191 24
 (18, 19),
1,6,-1,She was slightly taller than he though he was now his full height ( five feet ten and one half inches ) and
2,6,-1,despite her height
3,6,-1,shapely
4,6,-1,artistic in form and feature
5,6,-1,and with a certain unconscious placidity of soul
6,6,-1,which came more from lack of understanding than from force of character
7,6,-1,Her hair was the color of a dried English walnut
8,6,-1,rich and plentiful
9,6,-1,and her complexion waxen cream wax  with lips of faint pink
10,6,-1,and eyes that varied from gray to blue and from gray to brown
11,6,-1,according to the light in which you saw them
12,6,-1,Her hands were thin and shapely
13,6,-1,her nose straight
14,6,-1,her face artistically narrow
15,6,-1,She was not brilliant
16,6,-1,not active
17,6,-1,but rather peaceful and statuesque without knowing it
18,0,-1,Cowperwood was carried away by her appearance
19,6,-1,Her beauty measured up to his present sense of the artistic
20,6,-1,She was lovely
21,6,-1,he thought gracious
22,6,-1,dignified
23,6,-1,If he could have his choice of a wife
24,6,-1,this was the kind of a girl he would like to have .
186 12
 (5, 5),
1,6,-1,Instead of admiring this childish pastime
2,6,-1,which in Uganda is considered royal sport
3,6,-1,I rather looked disdainful
4,6,-1,until
5,1,-1,apparently disappointed at my indifference
6,6,-1,he asked what the box I had brought contained
7,6,-1,On being told it was the medicine he desired
8,6,-1,he asked me to draw near
9,6,-1,and sent his courtiers away
10,6,-1,When only the interpreters and one confidential officer were left
11,6,-1,besides myself
12,6,-1,he wished to know if I could apply the medicine without its touching the afflicted part .
544 12
 (11, 10),
1,6,-1,' but you will be quiet now
2,6,-1,' said Father
3,6,-1,raising his voice and interrupting him because none of the rules of normal family life ever applied to him
4,6,-1,' i have been very considerate of your feelings here
5,6,-1,Bruno
6,6,-1,because I know that this move is difficult for you
7,6,-1,And I have listened to what you have to say
8,6,-1,even though your youth and inexperience force you to phrase things in an insolent manner
9,6,-1,And youll notice that I have not reacted to any of this
10,6,-1,But the moment has come when you will simply have to accept that  i dont want to accept it
11,5,-1,' shouted Bruno
12,6,-1,blinking in 3 because he had not known he was going to shout out loud .
1657 3
 (1, 1),
1,1,-1,The distresses of the young couple at this period were subjects of pleasant reflexion during their prosperity as recorded in the Diary
2,6,-1,25th February
3,6,-1,1667 .
634 8
 (4, 1),
1,6,-1,' and yesterday he told me that his grandfather has n't been seen for days and no one knows where he is and whenever he asks his father about him he starts crying and hugs him so hard that he 's worried he 's going to squeeze him to death
2,6,-1,Bruno got to the end of his sentence and realized that his voice had gone very quiet
3,6,-1,These were things that Shmuel had told him
4,1,-1,but for some reason he had not really understood at the time how sad that must have  made his friend
5,6,-1,When Bruno said them out loud himself he felt terrible that he had not tried to say anything to cheer Shmuel up and instead had started talking about something silly
6,6,-1,like exploring
7,6,-1,i 'll say sorry for that tomorrow
8,6,-1,he told himself .
1257 16
 (6, 8),
1,6,-1,"  Well
2,6,-1,it 's lovely now
3,6,-1,is n't it
4,6,-1,"   breathed Mrs
5,6,-1,Butler
6,0,-1,"  Sure youll be happy here
7,6,-1,Sure you will
8,6,-1,When Eddie fixed the house we 're in now
9,6,-1,says I :  ' eddie
10,6,-1,it 's almost too fine for us altogether  surely it is
11,6,-1,' and he says
12,6,-1,says ' e
13,6,-1,' norah
14,6,-1,nothing ' this side o' heavin or beyond is too good for you ' and he kissed me
15,6,-1,Now what d'ye think of that fer a big
16,6,-1,hulking ' gossoon
1618 3
 (2, 2),
1,6,-1,So the spear Of the avenger slew him not
2,4,-1,whose doom Was one day wretchedly to be devoured By the manslaying Cyclops :  so it pleased Stern Fate
3,6,-1,I know not why .
927 5
 (2, 2),
1,6,-1,"  I might not have come
2,3,-1,"   Martin said with a sudden 5 that 3d himself
3,6,-1,"  She made no conditions
4,6,-1,I might have gone on with my life there abroad
5,6,-1,I am free to lead my own life where and how I please .  "
264 4
 (2, 1),
1,6,-1,Overcome by a flood of recollections
2,0,-1,the tears sprang to his eyes
3,6,-1,He embraced his mother
4,6,-1,and fled precipitately from the house .
1041 8
 (2, 2),
1,6,-1,But as the play continued she must listen
2,0,-1,It was her very first play and soon it was thrilling to her so that she forgot
3,6,-1,for a time
4,6,-1,even Martin
5,6,-1,Or rather Martin was mingled with it
6,6,-1,absorbed in it
7,6,-1,part of it
8,6,-1,and she was there too sharing with him the very action of the story .
2354 3
 (3, 3),
1,6,-1,Moniba had the most beautiful writing and presentation of the three of us
2,6,-1,but I always told her she did not trust herself enough
3,4,-1,e worked hard as she worried that if she got low marks her male relatives might use it as an excuse to stop her education .
149 9
 (5, 6),
1,6,-1,Leaving the valley of Uthenga
2,6,-1,we rose over the spur of N'yamwara
3,6,-1,where we found we had attained the delightful altitude of 5000 odd feet
4,6,-1,Oh
5,0,-1,how we enjoyed it
6,6,-1,every one feeling so happy at the prospect of meeting so soon the good king Rumanika
7,6,-1,Tripping down the greensward
8,6,-1,we now worked our way to the Rozoka valley
9,6,-1,and pitched our tents in the village .
1841 6
 (2, 2),
1,6,-1,but ten thousand times better thus than such scenes of lust let loose and abandoned animal ism as we witnessed at Honolulu
2,0,-1,What pleased me mightily was the absence of the white man with his air of superiority and sleek overlordship
3,6,-1,All the worship
4,6,-1,all the management of affairs
5,6,-1,was entirely in the hands of the natives themselves
6,6,-1,and excellently well did they manage everything .
1804 6
 (2, 2),
1,6,-1,Therefore
2,1,-1,we had all a rough time of it while his angry fit lasted
3,6,-1,which was a whole week
4,6,-1,or until all was shipshape again
5,6,-1,Meanwhile we were edging gradually through the Malacca Straits and around the big island of Borneo
6,6,-1,never going very near the land on account of the great and numerous dangers attendant upon coasting in those localities to any but those continually engaged in such a business .
580 9
 (7, 7),
1,6,-1,On this particular day
2,6,-1,however
3,6,-1,since it was a Saturday morning and was so sunny
4,6,-1,he was not so perfectly groomed
5,6,-1,Instead he was wearing a white vest over his trousers and his hair flopped down over his forehead in exhaustion
6,6,-1,His arms were surprisingly tanned and he had the kind of muscles that Bruno wished he had himself
7,3,-1,He looked so much younger today that Bruno was 3d
8,6,-1,in fact he reminded him of the big boys at school
9,6,-1,the ones he always steered clear of .
1295 25
 (25, 25),
1,6,-1,"  You know it cant stop this way
2,6,-1,dont you
3,6,-1,You know it
4,6,-1,This is n't the end
5,6,-1,Now
6,6,-1,if  "   He explained the whole theory of illicit meetings
7,6,-1,calmly
8,6,-1,dispassionately
9,6,-1,"  You are perfectly safe
10,6,-1,except for one thing
11,6,-1,chance exposure
12,6,-1,It might just so happen
13,6,-1,and then
14,6,-1,of course
15,6,-1,there would be a great deal to settle for
16,6,-1,Mrs
17,6,-1,Cowperwood would never give me a divorce
18,6,-1,she has no reason to
19,6,-1,If I should clean up in the way I hope to if I should make a million I would n't mind knocking off now
20,6,-1,I dont expect to work all my days
21,6,-1,I have always planned to knock off at thirty-five
22,6,-1,i 'll have enough by that time
23,6,-1,Then I want to travel
24,6,-1,It will only be a few more years now
25,3,-1,If you were free if your father and mother were dead "   curiously she did not wince at this practical reference  "  it would be a different matter .  "
910 8
 (2, 4),
1,6,-1,She hated sentiment and affectation in any one
2,4,-1,She was afraid
3,6,-1,too
4,6,-1,that Anne bullied Aunt Elizabeth
5,6,-1,Maggie was sorry for Aunt Elizabeth but
6,6,-1,with all the arrogance of the young
7,6,-1,a little despised her
8,6,-1,Why did she tremble and start like that
846 15
 (5, 5),
1,6,-1,The day was now gone
2,6,-1,so torches were lit
3,6,-1,and we were ordered to go
4,6,-1,though as yet I had not been able to speak one word I wished to impart about Petherick and Grant
5,4,-1,for my interpreters were so afraid of the king they dared not open their mouths until they were spoken to
6,6,-1,The king was now rising to go
7,6,-1,when
8,6,-1,in great fear and anxiety that the day would be lost
9,6,-1,I said
10,6,-1,in Kisuahili
11,6,-1,"  I wish you would send a letter by post to Grant
12,6,-1,and also send a boat up the Kitangule
13,6,-1,as far as Rumanika 's palace
14,6,-1,for him
15,6,-1,for he is totally unable to walk .  "
2005 2
 (2, 2),
1,6,-1,I wondered how it could happen that I was thinking of my father and my mother appeared
2,1,-1,and I felt a little guilty that I had not asked for her as well .
578 9
 (9, 9),
1,6,-1,Franz was one of the young men who fought for us in the trenches
2,6,-1,Your father knew him very well back then
3,6,-1,I believe they served together
4,6,-1,' and what happened to him
5,6,-1,' asked Bruno
6,6,-1,' it does n't matter
7,6,-1,' said Mother
8,6,-1,' war is not a fit subject for conversation
9,4,-1,im afraid we 'll be spending too much time talking about it soon . '
1291 13
 (7, 7),(12, 7),
1,6,-1,It is a question as to what would have happened if antagonistic forces could have been introduced just at this time
2,6,-1,Emotions and liaisons of this character can
3,6,-1,of course
4,6,-1,occasionally be broken up and destroyed
5,6,-1,The characters of the individuals can be modified or changed to a certain extent
6,6,-1,but the force must be quite sufficient
7,4,-1,Fear is a great deterrent 4 of material loss where there is no spiritual dread but wealth and position so often tend to destroy this dread
8,6,-1,It is so easy to scheme with means
9,6,-1,Aileen had no spiritual dread whatever
10,6,-1,Cowperwood was without spiritual or religious feeling
11,6,-1,He looked at this girl
12,4,-1,and his one thought was how could he so deceive the world that he could enjoy her love and leave his present state undisturbed
13,6,-1,Love her he did surely .
1963 14
 (13, 13),
1,6,-1,Shmuel pointed at Bruno 's feet and the heavy boots he had taken from the house
2,6,-1,' youll have to leave them behind too
3,6,-1,' he said
4,6,-1,Bruno looked appalled
5,6,-1,' but the mud
6,6,-1,' he said
7,6,-1,' you cant expect me to go barefoot
8,6,-1,' youll be recognized otherwise
9,6,-1,' said Shmuel
10,6,-1,' you dont have any choice
11,6,-1,Bruno sighed but he knew that his friend was right
12,6,-1,and he took off the boots and his socks and left them beside the pile of clothes on the ground
13,4,-1,At first it felt horrible putting his bare feet into so much mud
14,6,-1,they sank down to his ankles and every time he lifted a foot it felt worse .
592 8
 (7, 6),
1,6,-1,dont argue with me go to your room
2,6,-1,' she insisted
3,6,-1,and Bruno stepped off the chair
4,6,-1,putting his weight on what he had decided to call his bad leg
5,6,-1,and it hurt a little
6,6,-1,He turned and left the room but was still able to hear Mother saying thank you to Pavel as he walked towards the stairs
7,0,-1,and this  made Bruno happy because surely it was obvious to everyone that if it had not been for him
8,6,-1,he would have bled to death .
129 8
 (2, 4),
1,6,-1,The Arabs
2,1,-1,after the first burst of their grief was over
3,6,-1,came to me again in a body
4,6,-1,and begged me to assist them
5,6,-1,for they were utterly undone
6,6,-1,Manua Sera prevented their direct communication with their detachment at Mdaburu
7,6,-1,and that again was cut off from their caravans at Kanyenye by the Mzanza people
8,6,-1,and in fact all the Wagogo
1292 22
 (4, 5),
1,6,-1,And as for safeguards against the production of new life they were not mysteries to him any longer
2,6,-1,He knew all about them
3,6,-1,Care was the point of caution
4,4,-1,He had to be cautious
5,6,-1,for he was so rapidly coming to be an influential and a distinguished man
6,6,-1,Aileen
7,6,-1,of course
8,6,-1,was not conscious
9,6,-1,except in a vague way
10,6,-1,of the drift of her passion
11,6,-1,the ultimate destiny to which this affection might lead was not clear to her
12,6,-1,Her craving was for love to be fondled and caressed and she really did not think so much further
13,6,-1,Further thoughts along this line were like rats that showed their heads out of dark holes in shadowy corners and scuttled back at the least sound
14,6,-1,And
15,6,-1,anyhow
16,6,-1,all that was to be connected with Cowperwood would be beautiful
17,6,-1,She really did not think that he loved her yet as he should
18,6,-1,but he would
19,6,-1,She did not know that she wanted to interfere with the claims of his wife
20,6,-1,She did not think she did
21,6,-1,But it would not hurt Mrs
22,6,-1,Cowperwood if Frank loved her Aileen also .
2171 4
 (4, 2),(4, 4),
1,6,-1,She didnt want her mother to have a kind of authority that Mariel wasnt used to
2,6,-1,and she felt somewhat pushed away emotionally
3,6,-1,Yet at the same time her mother seemed more present and loving
4,1,-1,The changes left Mariel feeling confused .
1938 7
 (3, 6),
1,6,-1,It wasnt that they could show him anything
2,6,-1,it was  only that they could burn clear
3,3,-1,To his surprise
4,6,-1,however
5,6,-1,after a  while
6,6,-1,they did show him something :   the arch of a high doorway  approached by a low terrace of steps
7,6,-1,in the depth of which - it  formed a dim vestibule - the raising of a curtain at the moment he  passed gave him a glimpse of an avenue of gloom with a glow of  tapers at the end .
568 9
 (6, 1),(6, 2),
1,6,-1,Bruno recognized footsteps pounding up the stairs towards them
2,6,-1,quicker and quicker
3,6,-1,and he crawled back on the bed
4,6,-1,pressing himself against the wall
5,6,-1,suddenly afraid of what was going to happen next
6,4,-1,He held his breath
7,6,-1,expecting trouble
8,6,-1,but it was only Gretel
9,6,-1,the Hopeless Case .
1956 4
 (3, 4),
1,6,-1,' that 's true
2,6,-1,' said Shmuel
3,1,-1,lowering the fence again and looking at the ground with tears in his eyes
4,6,-1,I suppose i 'll see you tomorrow to say goodbye then . '
1074 7
 (4, 5),
1,6,-1,"  But
2,6,-1,my dear child
3,6,-1,"   said Miss Avies
4,3,-1,astonished
5,6,-1,"  How can you say you loved one another if you were always quarrelling and expecting to part
6,6,-1,"    "  We were n't always quarrelling
7,6,-1,"   said Maggie .
539 9
 (5, 3),
1,6,-1,Bruno looked around
2,6,-1,His gaze landed on the window in the corner of the room and through it he could see the awful landscape beyond
3,6,-1,' did you do something wrong
4,6,-1,' he asked after a moment
5,5,-1,' something that  made the Fury angry
6,6,-1,me
7,6,-1,' said Father
8,6,-1,looking at him in 3
9,6,-1,' what do you mean
1668 4
 (4, 4),
1,6,-1,This day we had news of the election at Huntingdon for Bernard and Pedley
2,6,-1,John Bernard and Nicholas Pedley
3,6,-1,re-elected in the next Parliament
4,2,-1,at which my Lord was much troubled for his friends missing of it .
122 9
 (4, 4),
1,6,-1,wo taxes in five miles was a thing unheard of
2,6,-1,and I heard no more about the matter
3,6,-1,until Bombay in the evening told me how Sheikh Said
4,4,-1,fearing awkward consequences
5,6,-1,had settled to give two dubuani
6,6,-1,one being taken from his own store
7,6,-1,Lion 's Claw also turned up again
8,6,-1,getting his cloths of yesterday one more being added from the Sheikh 's stores and he was then advised to go off quietly
9,6,-1,as I was a fire eater whom nobody dared approach after my orders had been issued .
394 5
 (4, 5),
1,6,-1,"  I was much grieved at the count 's disappointment
2,6,-1,"   continued Mademoiselle Marguerite
3,6,-1,"  but suddenly he exclaimed
4,0,-1,joyfully :  ' that address why
5,6,-1,such a person will give it to me what a fool I am
1513 3
 (1, 1),
1,1,-1,Then at his cry that brother 's heart was stung With bitter grief
2,6,-1,Swift for his help drew nigh Phereus
3,6,-1,on whom for his great prince 's fall Came anguish .
665 10
 (1, 9),(1, 10),
1,0,-1,Over the course of the next few weeks Mother seemed increasingly unhappy with life at out with and Bruno understood perfectly well why that might be
2,6,-1,After all
3,6,-1,when they 'd first arrived he had hated it
4,6,-1,due to the fact that it was nothing like home and lacked such things as three best friends for life
5,6,-1,But that had changed for him over time
6,6,-1,mostly due to Shmuel
7,6,-1,who had become more important to him than Karl or Daniel or Martin had ever been
8,6,-1,But Mother didnt have a Shmuel of her own
9,6,-1,There was no one for her to talk to
10,6,-1,and the only person who she had been remotely friendly with the young Lieutenant Kotler had been transferred somewhere else .
651 8
 (4, 7),
1,6,-1,' shmuel
2,6,-1,' he said
3,6,-1,running towards him and sitting down
4,1,-1,almost crying with relief and regret
5,6,-1,' im so sorry
6,6,-1,Shmuel
7,6,-1,I dont know why I did it
8,6,-1,Say youll forgive me . '
993 11
 (6, 7),
1,6,-1,And this figure
2,6,-1,Martin knew
3,6,-1,was a prey to every morbid desire
4,6,-1,rushed to sensual excess and then crept back miserably to search for some spiritual flagellation
5,6,-1,Above all
6,1,-1,it was restless
7,6,-1,as some one presses round a dark room searching for the lock of the door
8,6,-1,restless and lonely
9,6,-1,cowardly and selfish
10,6,-1,but searching and sensitive and even faithful
11,6,-1,faithful to something or to some one
548 6
 (6, 2),
1,6,-1,He walked towards the door
2,6,-1,but before opening it he turned round and asked one final question
3,6,-1,' father
4,6,-1,' he began
5,6,-1,' bruno
6,5,-1,im not going to ' began Father irritably .
1579 11
 (10, 11),
1,6,-1,Yet had their might Availed not for defence
2,6,-1,for all their will
3,6,-1,Had Teucer and Idomeneus strong of heart Come not to help
4,6,-1,with Thoas
5,6,-1,Meriones
6,6,-1,And godlike Thrasymedes
7,6,-1,they which shrank Erewhile before Eurypylus yea
8,6,-1,had fled Unto the ships to  ' scape the crushing doom
9,6,-1,But that
10,4,-1,in fear for atreus ' sons
11,6,-1,they rallied Against Eurypylus :  deadly waxed the fight .
2397 18
 (12, 12),
1,6,-1,Mrs
2,6,-1,Allen immediately recognized the features of a former school fellow and intimate
3,6,-1,whom she had seen only once since their respective marriages
4,6,-1,and that many years ago
5,6,-1,Their joy on this meeting was very great
6,6,-1,as well it might
7,6,-1,since they had been contented to know nothing of each other for the last fifteen years
8,6,-1,Compliments on good looks now passed
9,6,-1,and
10,6,-1,after observing how time had slipped away since they were last together
11,6,-1,how little they had thought of meeting in Bath
12,0,-1,and what a pleasure it was to see an old friend
13,6,-1,they proceeded to make inquiries and give intelligence as to their families
14,6,-1,sisters
15,6,-1,and cousins
16,6,-1,talking both together
17,6,-1,far more ready to give than to receive information
18,6,-1,and each hearing very little of what the other said .
615 10
 (7, 6),
1,6,-1,Bruno was about to leave when the food caught his eye and a question came into his mind that had been bothering him for some time
2,6,-1,He had not been able to think of anyone to ask before
3,6,-1,but this seemed like a perfect moment and the perfect person
4,6,-1,' maria
5,6,-1,' he said
6,6,-1,' can I ask you a question
7,3,-1,' The maid turned round and looked at him in 3
8,6,-1,' of course
9,6,-1,Master Bruno
10,6,-1,' she said .
1622 3
 (1, 1),
1,1,-1,Even as in agony he leapt full height
2,6,-1,Yet once again the archer 's arrow hissed :  It pierced his throat
3,6,-1,through the neck sinews cleft Unswerving
2042 5
 (5, 5),
1,6,-1,"  By the way
2,6,-1,James
3,6,-1,"   Margaret said
4,6,-1,holding the stem of her glass
5,0,-1,"  I want to say how awfully grateful I am to you for your tact these last couple of weeks .  "
2055 37
 (18, 18),
1,6,-1,Well
2,6,-1,i 've tried to say  "  HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE
3,6,-1,"   but it all came different
4,6,-1,' Alice replied in a very melancholy voice
5,6,-1,repeat
6,6,-1,"  YOU ARE OLD
7,6,-1,FATHER WILLIAM
8,6,-1,"  ' said the Caterpillar  .  Alice folded her hands
9,6,-1,and began :  You are old
10,6,-1,Father William
11,6,-1,' the young man said
12,6,-1,And your hair has become very white
13,6,-1,And yet you incessantly stand on your head  Do you think
14,6,-1,at your age
15,6,-1,it is right
16,6,-1,'  In my youth
17,6,-1,' Father William replied to his son
18,4,-1,I 4ed it might injure the brain
19,6,-1,But
20,6,-1,now that im perfectly sure I have none
21,6,-1,Why
22,6,-1,I do it again and again
23,6,-1,You are old
24,6,-1,' said the youth
25,6,-1,as I mentioned before
26,6,-1,And have grown most uncommonly fat
27,6,-1,Yet you turned a back somersault in at the door  Pray
28,6,-1,what is the reason of that
29,6,-1,'  In my youth
30,6,-1,' said the sage
31,6,-1,as he shook his grey locks
32,6,-1,I kept all my limbs very supple By the use of this ointment one shilling the box  Allow me to sell you a couple
33,6,-1,'  You are old
34,6,-1,' said the youth
35,6,-1,and your jaws are too weak For anything tougher than suet
36,6,-1,Yet you finished the goose
37,6,-1,with the bones and the beak  Pray how did you manage to do it
2098 8
 (3, 3),(3, 4),
1,6,-1,James smiled and coloured with pleasure
2,6,-1,the fantastic message was not devoid of reality in the days when young imaginative spirits tried to hide the prose of war and policy in a bright mist of romantic fancy
3,1,-1,nor was he ashamed to bend his manly head in reverence to
4,6,-1,and even press to his lips
5,6,-1,his lady 's first love letter
6,6,-1,in the very sight of the satirical though sympathizing Bedford
7,6,-1,of whom he eagerly asked of the fair Joan 's health and welfare
8,6,-1,and whether she were flouted by Queen Catherine .
1961 7
 (4, 2),
1,6,-1,Shmuel pointed at Bruno 's feet and the heavy boots he had taken from the house
2,6,-1,' youll have to leave them behind too
3,6,-1,' he said
4,3,-1,Bruno looked appalled
5,6,-1,' but the mud
6,6,-1,' he said
7,6,-1,' you cant expect me to go barefoot . '
2620 5
 (4, 4),
1,6,-1,When we were all too tired to stay awake 
2,6,-1,Goodnight 
3,6,-1,putting a hand on my head
4,0,-1,i 'll take care of you  .   It s very kind of you 
5,6,-1,You haven t got a sister 
1495 4
 (1, 1),
1,0,-1,The glorious trito born with courage thrilled to bring to all his foes the day of doom And Polypoetes
2,6,-1,dear to Ares
3,6,-1,slew Dresaeus
4,6,-1,whom the Nymph Neaera bare To passing wise Theiodamas for these Spread was the bed of   love .
741 8
 (5, 4),
1,6,-1,She at once concluded that her husband had taken it and would shortly bring it back
2,6,-1,She waited for him till evening rather impatiently
3,6,-1,and wondering what could have kept him from her so long
4,6,-1,When night came without him she felt in despair and abused the talisman and its maker roundly
5,4,-1,In spite of her grief and anxiety however
6,6,-1,she did not lose her presence of mind
7,6,-1,but decided on a courageous
8,6,-1,though very unusual step .
1900 7
 (4, 4),(4, 5),
1,6,-1,Drawing him by those appeals
2,6,-1,and warily noting the right spot to plant his blow
3,6,-1,he turned the other edge of his sword to the front
4,4,-1,fearing that the thin side of his blade was too frail for his strength
5,6,-1,and smote with a piercing stroke through the prince 's body
6,6,-1,When Wermund heard it
7,6,-1,he said that the sound of his sword  "  Skrep "   had reached his ear for the second time .
1162 8
 (6, 5),
1,6,-1,The Cowperwoods
2,6,-1,father and mother
3,6,-1,were not so lean and narrow that they could not enter into the natural tendency to be happy and joyous with their children
4,6,-1,and so this family
5,6,-1,which increased at the rate of a child every two or three years after Frank 's birth until there were four children
6,0,-1,was quite an interesting affair when he was ten and they were ready to move into the New Market Street home
7,6,-1,Henry Worthington Cowperwood 's connections were increased as his position grew more responsible
8,6,-1,and gradually he was becoming quite a personage .
2095 16
 (5, 5),
1,6,-1,Blows hailed thick on the door
2,6,-1,a flaming torch was handed over the heads of the throng
3,6,-1,horrible growls and roars pervaded them
4,6,-1,Malcolm and Ralf
5,5,-1,furious at the cheat
6,6,-1,stood among the foremost
7,6,-1,making so much noise themselves between thundering and reviling
8,6,-1,and calling out
9,6,-1,' where are the Armagnacs
10,6,-1,Down with the traitors
11,6,-1,' that they were not aware of a sudden hush behind them
12,6,-1,till a buffet from a heavy hand fell on Malcolm 's shoulder
13,6,-1,and a mighty voice cried  ' shame
14,6,-1,shame
15,6,-1,What
16,6,-1,you too
25 8
 (8, 1),
1,6,-1,Scott assigned  1 to Wozniak and  2 to Jobs
2,6,-1,Not surprisingly
3,6,-1,Jobs demanded to be  1
4,6,-1,I would n't let him have it
5,6,-1,because that would stoke his ego even more
6,6,-1,said Scott
7,6,-1,Jobs threw a tantrum
8,1,-1,even cried .
2480 6
 (5, 6),
1,6,-1,Mr Denny addressed them directly
2,6,-1,and entreated permission to introduce his friend
3,6,-1,Mr Wickham
4,6,-1,who had returned with him the day before from town
5,0,-1,and he was happy to say
6,6,-1,had accepted a commission in their corps .
718 6
 (4, 2),
1,6,-1,Jobs stood back and proudly gazed at his new Macintosh
2,6,-1,It looks like it 's from another planet
3,6,-1,he said
4,0,-1,as the audience laughed
5,6,-1,a good planet
6,6,-1,A planet with better designers .
23 2
 (2, 2),
1,6,-1,Like Markkula
2,2,-1,he hated dealing with the conflicts that Jobs engendered .
1013 8
 (5, 3),
1,6,-1,She was confident because she did not think
2,6,-1,she simply did not think at all
3,6,-1,She loved Martin and Martin loved her
4,6,-1,cased in that golden armour
5,0,-1,she confronted her aunts and the house and the world behind the house with a sublime and happy confidence
6,6,-1,She loved her aunts now
7,6,-1,she loved Martha and the parrot and the cat
8,6,-1,and she could not believe that they did not all love her .
733 6
 (6, 4),
1,6,-1,He continued to insist that the Microsoft approach of using a stylus for input would prevail
2,6,-1,i 've been predicting a tablet with a stylus for many years
3,6,-1,he told me
4,6,-1,I will eventually turn out to be right or be dead
5,6,-1,e night after his announcement
6,1,-1,Jobs was annoyed and depressed .
710 9
 (3, 3),
1,6,-1,Fortunat left the restaurant
2,6,-1,almost on the run
3,4,-1,for he feared that he might be pursued and overtaken by MCasimir
4,6,-1,But after he had gone a couple of hundred paces
5,6,-1,he paused
6,6,-1,not so much to take breath
7,6,-1,as to collect his scattered wits
8,6,-1,and though the weather was cold
9,6,-1,he seated himself on a bench to reflect .
2068 20
 (9, 9),
1,6,-1,When we were little
2,6,-1,' the Mock Turtle went on at last
3,6,-1,more calmly
4,6,-1,though still sobbing a little now and then
5,6,-1,we went to school in the sea . The master was an old Turtle we used to call him Tortoise '  Why did you call him Tortoise
6,6,-1,if he wasnt one
7,6,-1,' Alice asked We called him Tortoise because he taught us
8,6,-1,' said the Mock Turtle angrily :   really you are very dull
9,1,-1,'  You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question
10,6,-1,' added the Gryphon
11,6,-1,and then they both sat silent and looked at poor Alice
12,6,-1,who felt ready to sink into the earth . At last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle
13,6,-1,Drive on
14,6,-1,old fellow
15,6,-1,dont be all day about it
16,6,-1,' and he went on in these words :   Yes
17,6,-1,we went to school in the sea
18,6,-1,though you may n't believe it '  I never said I didnt
19,6,-1,' interrupted Alice You did
20,6,-1,' said the Mock Turtle
1542 5
 (5, 5),
1,6,-1,For out of depths of sorrow rose their moan
2,6,-1,And all the armour
3,6,-1,yea
4,6,-1,the tents
5,1,-1,the ships Of that great sorrowing multitude were wet With tears from ever welling springs of grief .
2483 5
 (4, 3),
1,6,-1,"  It is not Mr Bingley
2,6,-1,"   said her husband
3,6,-1,"  it is a person whom I never saw in the whole course of my life
4,3,-1,his roused a general astonishment
5,6,-1,and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once .
1753 9
 (5, 5),
1,6,-1,I felt sure
2,6,-1,however
3,6,-1,that we should have but little more trouble with our fish
4,6,-1,In fact
5,4,-1,I was half afraid that he would die before getting to the surface
6,6,-1,in which case he might sink and be lost
7,6,-1,We hauled steadily away
8,6,-1,the line not coming in very easily

19,6,-1,which sparkled and shone like the most beautiful jewels
20,6,-1,She took these with her to please the Sultan
21,6,-1,and set out
22,6,-1,trusting in the lamp
23,6,-1,The grand vizir and the lords of council had just gone in as she entered the hall and placed herself in front of the Sultan
24,6,-1,He
25,6,-1,however
26,6,-1,took no notice of her
27,6,-1,She went every day for a week
28,6,-1,and stood in the same place .

1,6,-1,"  At least
2,6,-1,you two have decent manners
3,6,-1,"   says Effie as we 're finishing the main course
4,6,-1,"  The pair last year ate everything with their hands like a couple of savages
5,2,-1,It completely upset my digestion
6,6,-1,he pair last year were two kids from the Seam who 'd never
7,6,-1,not one day of their lives
8,6,-1,had enough to eat
9,6,-1,And when they did have food
10,6,-1,table manners were surely the last thing on their minds .

1,1,-1,"  Parents are often upset when their children praise the homes of their friends and regard it as a slur on their own cooking
2,6,-1,or cleaning
3,6,-1,or furniture

 (28, 22),
1,6,-1,She had stood before her mirror between eight and nine it was nine fifteen before she was really ready and pondered over what she should wear
2,6,-1,There were two tall pier glasses in her wardrobe  an unduly large piece of furniture and one in her closet door
3,6,-1,She stood before the latter
4,6,-1,looking at her bare arms and shoulders
5,6,-1,her shapely figure
6,6,-1,thinking of the fact that her left shoulder had a dimple
7,6,-1,and that she had selected garnet garters decorated with heart-shaped silver buckles
8,6,-1,The corset could not be made quite tight enough at first
9,6,-1,and she chided her maid
10,6,-1,Kathleen Kelly
11,6,-1,She studied how to arrange her hair
12,6,-1,and there was much ado about that before it was finally adjusted
13,6,-1,She penciled her eyebrows and plucked at the hair about her forehead to make it loose and shadowy
14,6,-1,She cut black court plaster with her nail shears and tried different-sized pieces in different places
15,6,-1,Finally
16,6,-1,she found one size and one place that suited her
17,6,-1,She turned her head from side to side
18,6,-1,looking at the combined effect of her hair
19,6,-1,her penciled brows
20,6,-1,her dimpled shoulder
21,6,-1,and the black beauty spot
22,6,-1,If some one man could see her as she was now
23,6,-1,some time
24,6,-1,Which man
25,6,-1,That thought scurried back like a frightened rat into its hole
26,6,-1,She was
27,6,-1,for all her strength
28,4,-1,afraid of the thought of the one the very deadly the man .

1,6,-1,Bruno looked around
2,6,-1,His gaze landed on the window in the corner of the room and through it he could see the awful landscape beyond
3,6,-1,' did you do something wrong
4,6,-1,' he asked after a moment
5,6,-1,' something that  made the Fury angry
6,6,-1,me
7,6,-1,' said Father
8,3,-1,looking at him in 3
9,6,-1,' what do you mean

 (11, 8),
1,6,-1,"  By a single word the count could have insured the happiness of my life and his own
2,6,-1,but he did not speak it
3,6,-1,He was the kindest and most indulgent of guardians
4,6,-1,and I was often affected to tears by his tenderness
5,6,-1,But
6,6,-1,although my slightest wish was law
7,6,-1,he did not grant me his confidence
8,6,-1,the mystery that stood between us was like a wall of ice  Still
9,6,-1,I was gradually becoming accustomed to my new life
10,6,-1,and my mind was regaining its equilibrium
11,2,-1,when one evening the count returned home more agitated and excited
12,6,-1,if possible
13,6,-1,than on the day of my departure from the asylum
14,6,-1,He summoned his valet
15,6,-1,and
16,6,-1,in a tone that admitted no reply
17,6,-1,he exclaimed
18,6,-1,' i wish to leave Cannes at once  I must start in less than an hour so procure some post horses instantly
19,6,-1,And in answer to my inquiring glance
20,6,-1,he said :  ' it must be

2,6,-1,' the wound has been cleaned
3,6,-1,' he said quietly
4,6,-1,not answering Bruno 's question
5,4,-1,' there 's nothing to worry about . '
489 9
 (5, 5),
1,6,-1,As he received high wages
2,6,-1,he served passably well
3,6,-1,but he employed the best part of his energy in watching the count
4,6,-1,He scented some great family secret in the household
5,5,-1,and he felt angry and humiliated that this secret had not been entrusted to his discretion
6,6,-1,And if he had discovered nothing
7,6,-1,it was because M
8,6,-1,de Chalusse had been caution personified
9,6,-1,as Madame Leon had declared .

2,6,-1,Seating himself he asked for the king .
141 13
 (4, 5),
1,6,-1,I then told the Pig and Baraka to settle at once
2,6,-1,They no sooner did so than the drums beat
3,6,-1,and Makaka
4,0,-1,in the best humour possible
5,6,-1,came over to say I had permission to go when I liked
6,6,-1,but he hoped I would give him a gun and a box of lucifer s
7,6,-1,This was too provoking
8,6,-1,The perpetual worry had given Baraka a fever
9,6,-1,and had made me feel quite sick
10,6,-1,so I said
11,6,-1,if he ever mentioned a gun or lucifer ss again
12,6,-1,I would fight the matter out with him
13,6,-1,for I had not come there to be bullied .

1,6,-1,' say goodbye to them
2,6,-1,' he asked
3,6,-1,staring at her in 3
4,6,-1,' say goodbye to them
5,6,-1,' he repeated
6,6,-1,spluttering out the words as if his mouth was full of biscuits that he 'd munched into tiny pieces but not actually swallowed yet
7,6,-1,' say goodbye to Karl and Daniel and Martin
8,6,-1,' he continued
9,5,-1,his voice coming d5ously close to shouting

 (12, 11),
1,6,-1,As soon as divine service was over
2,6,-1,the Thorpes and Allens eagerly joined each other
3,6,-1,and after staying long enough in the pump room to discover that the crowd was insupportable
4,6,-1,and that there was not a genteel face to be seen
5,6,-1,which everybody discovers every Sunday throughout the season
6,6,-1,they hastened away to the Crescent
7,6,-1,to breathe the fresh air of better company
8,6,-1,Here Catherine and Isabella
9,6,-1,arm in arm
10,6,-1,again tasted the sweets of friendship in an unreserved conversation
11,6,-1,they talked much
12,0,-1,and with much enjoyment
13,6,-1,but again was Catherine disappointed in her hope of re seeing her partner .
102 4
 (2, 1),
1,6,-1,What did he think of the suggestion that Apple sometimes acted arrogantly
2,4,-1,im not worried about that
3,6,-1,he said
4,6,-1,because we 're not arrogant .
959 11
 (6, 2),(7, 2),
1,6,-1,She loved Martin and Martin loved her
2,6,-1,Soon Martin would marry her and they would go away
3,6,-1,Her aunt would be sorry of course
4,6,-1,and his father
5,6,-1,perhaps
6,5,-1,would be angry
7,5,-1,but the sorrow and 5 would be only for a little while
8,6,-1,Then Martin and she would live happily together always happily because they were both sensible people
9,6,-1,and her own standard of fidelity and trust was
10,6,-1,she supposed
11,6,-1,also his .

1,1,-1,Bruno bit his lip
2,6,-1,He had hoped that Maria would take his side in the campaign to get away from out with but he could see where her loyalties really lay

 (6, 6),
1,6,-1,The prince
2,6,-1,who had watched the whole scene with much interest
3,6,-1,now drew near the spot where it happened
4,6,-1,and glancing at the dead bird he noticed something red lying near which had evidently fallen out of its inside
5,6,-1,He picked it up
6,3,-1,and what was his surprise when he recognised the Princess Badoura 's talisman which had been the cause of many misfortunes
7,6,-1,It would be impossible to describe his joy
8,6,-1,he kissed the talisman repeatedly
9,6,-1,wrapped it up
10,6,-1,and carefully tied it round his arm
11,6,-1,For the first time since his separation from the princess he had a good night
12,6,-1,and next morning he was up at day break and went cheerfully to ask what work he should do .
128 11
 (5, 5),
1,6,-1,Days rolled on
2,6,-1,and nothing was done in particular  beyond increasing my stock of knowledge of distant places and people
3,6,-1,enlarging my zoological collection
4,6,-1,and taking long series of astronomical observations until the 13th
5,1,-1,when the whole of Kaze was depressed by a sad scene of mourning and tears
6,6,-1,Some slaves came in that night having made their way through the woods from Ugogo
7,6,-1,avoiding the track to save themselves from detection  and gave information that Snay
8,6,-1,Jafu
9,6,-1,and five other Arabs
10,6,-1,had been killed
11,6,-1,as well as a great number of slaves .

3,6,-1,Hell fire has become
4,6,-1,I think
5,6,-1,to many of the present generation a mockery and a derision
6,6,-1,I come to tell you that it is no mockery
7,6,-1,that it as surely lies there
8,6,-1,a blazing furnace
9,6,-1,in front of us as though we saw it with our own eyes
399 7
 (3, 3),
1,6,-1,As a rule
2,6,-1,Chupin was not easily impressed
3,4,-1,but he felt almost frightened by his employer 's agitation

4,6,-1,of course
5,6,-1,never been to a theatre
6,6,-1,She could not imagine in the least what it was like .

5,0,-1,and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once .
1255 12
 (8, 6),(8, 7),
1,6,-1,It was curious
2,6,-1,though
3,6,-1,that it was Aileen who commanded nearly all their attention and fixed their minds on her so-called idiosyncrasies
4,6,-1,All they said was in its peculiar way true
5,6,-1,but in addition the girl was really beautiful and much above the average intelligence and force
6,6,-1,She was running deep with ambition
7,6,-1,and she was all the more conspicuous
8,5,-1,and in a way irritating to some
9,6,-1,because she reflected in her own consciousness her social defects
10,6,-1,against which she was inwardly fighting
11,6,-1,She resented the fact that people could justly consider her parents ineligible
12,6,-1,and for that reason her also .
1866 11

1,6,-1,This announcement

8,6,-1,well pleased with the eagerness manifested
9,6,-1,had his boat manned for a trip to the entrance of the harbour
10,6,-1,to see what the weather was like outside
11,6,-1,since it was not possible to judge from where the ship lay .
1737 6
 (5, 6),
1,6,-1,but as we secured five of them
2,6,-1,averaging seven barrels each
3,6,-1,with scarcely any trouble
4,6,-1,I felt quite pleased with myself
5,0,-1,We had quite an exciting bit of sport with them
6,6,-1,they were so lively .
389 10
 (4, 4),
1,6,-1,Their faces were pale and sad
2,6,-1,and there were tears in the eyes of some of them
3,6,-1,What was passing in their minds
4,4,-1,Perhaps they were overcome by that unconquerable fear which sudden and unexpected death always provokes
5,6,-1,Perhaps they unconsciously loved this master
6,6,-1,whose bread they ate
7,6,-1,Perhaps their grief was only selfishness
8,6,-1,and they were merely wondering what would become of them
9,6,-1,where they should find another situation
10,6,-1,and if it would prove a good one .
569 1

2,6,-1,and feebly stretching out one paw
3,6,-1,trying to touch her Poor little thing
4,6,-1,' said Alice
5,6,-1,in a coaxing tone
6,6,-1,and she tried hard to whistle to it
7,4,-1,but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry
8,6,-1,in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing Hardly knowing what she did
9,6,-1,she picked up a little bit of stick
10,6,-1,and held it out to the puppy
11,6,-1,whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once
12,6,-1,with a yelp of delight
13,6,-1,and rushed at the stick
14,6,-1,and made believe to worry it
15,6,-1,then Alice dodged behind a great thistle
16,6,-1,to keep herself from being run over
17,6,-1,and the moment she appeared on the other side
18,6,-1,the puppy made another rush at the stick
19,6,-1,and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it
20,6,-1,then Alice
21,6,-1,thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart horse
22,6,-1,and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet
23,6,-1,ran round the thistle again
24,6,-1,then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick
25,6,-1,running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back
26,6,-1,and barking hoarsely all the while
27,6,-1,till at last it sat down a good way off
28,6,-1,panting
29,6,-1,with its tongue hanging out of its mouth
30,6,-1,and its great eyes half shut .

1,6,-1,Cowperwood
2,6,-1,warm with this enhancing of his financial prospects
3,6,-1,went down the steps
4,0,-1,but incidentally he spared a passing thought for the gay spirit of youth that had manifested itself in this red cheeked maiden
5,6,-1,What a bright
6,6,-1,healthy
7,6,-1,bounding girl
8,6,-1,Her voice had the subtle
9,6,-1,vigorous ring of fifteen or sixteen
10,6,-1,She was all vitality
11,6,-1,What a fine catch for some young fellow some day
12,6,-1,and her father would make him rich

1244 9
 (1, 1),
1,4,-1,But these facts of wealth and advantage gripped her
2,6,-1,and when she sat at the piano and played or rode in her carriage or walked or stood before her mirror
3,6,-1,she was conscious of her figure
4,6,-1,her charms
5,6,-1,what they meant to men
6,6,-1,how women envied her
7,6,-1,Sometimes she looked at poor
8,6,-1,hollow chested or homely faced girls and felt sorry for them
9,6,-1,at other times she flared into inexplicable opposition to some handsome girl or woman who dared to brazen her socially or physically .

 (4, 4),
1,6,-1,"  Why
2,6,-1,Nancy Arabella

7,6,-1,But look at you

8,6,-1,She threatened her brother
9,6,-1,but she would never have carried her threats into execution

2,6,-1,impaling them Where sharpest stings the anguish laden steel . And all about the city dolorous howls Of dogs up rose
3,1,-1,and miserable moans Of strong men stricken to death
4,6,-1,and every home With awful cries was echoing Rang the shrieks Of women .

 (4, 3),
1,6,-1,The following day a grand dinner was served to us but as my wife did not appear
2,6,-1,I ordered a servant to call her
3,6,-1,Still she did not come
4,2,-1,and I waited impatiently for some time
5,6,-1,At last she entered the room
6,6,-1,and she took our places at the table
7,6,-1,and plates of rice were set before us .

 (3, 3),
1,6,-1,But that afternoon i had to leave for Chicago to attend an important conference
2,6,-1,so i told my grandmother that i would hear her story when i return back after three days
3,1,-1,It was quite painful for me to leave her but i was compelled my office .

 (3, 3),
1,6,-1,Bruno had not seen his grandmother since leaving Berlin but he had thought about her every day
2,6,-1,The things he remembered most about her were the productions that she and he and Gretel performed at Christmas and birthdays and how she always had the perfect costume to suit whatever role he played
3,1,-1,When he thought that they would never be able to do that again it  made him very sad indeed .

 (7, 2),
1,6,-1,But by the time the Lisa was ready to ship in the spring of 1983
2,6,-1,it was clear that the Twiggy was buggy
3,6,-1,Because the Lisa also came with a hard-disk drive
4,6,-1,this was not a complete disaster
5,6,-1,But the Mac had no hard disk
6,6,-1,so it faced a crisis

 (3, 3),
1,6,-1,It was the window of a jeweller whose diamonds and  sapphires seemed to laugh
2,6,-1,in flashes like high notes of sound
3,0,-1,with the mere joy of knowing how much more they were  "  worth "   than  most of the dingy pedestrians staring at them from the other side  of the pane
4,6,-1,Stransom lingered long enough to suspend
5,6,-1,in a  vision
6,6,-1,a string of pearls about the white neck of Mary Antrim
7,6,-1,and  then was kept an instant longer by the sound of a voice he knew .
950 7
 (3, 3),
1,6,-1,on his side
2,6,-1,as he looked down at her
3,3,-1,was 3d at his own excitement
4,6,-1,His heart was beating

6,6,-1,ordinary
7,6,-1,unattractive girl

1,6,-1,"  He 's only a boy
2,6,-1,"   she used to say to herself and feel his elder by at least twenty years
3,1,-1,Nevertheless the thought of his struggling on there alone was not a happy one
4,6,-1,She longed
5,6,-1,even though she might not advise him
6,6,-1,to comfort him
7,6,-1,She was beginning to realise something of her own power over him and to see
8,6,-1,too
9,6,-1,the strange mixture of superstition and self reproach and self distrust that overwhelmed him when she was not with him .
1945 7
 (6, 5),
1,6,-1,The prince could hardly believe his ears
2,6,-1,and rode off as hard as he could

4,6,-1,and arrived safe and sound at his father 's house
5,6,-1,where he told him of the danger he had run because of the grand vizir 's carelessness

7,6,-1,and had him strangled immediately .

2,6,-1,Soon Martin would marry her and they would go away
3,6,-1,Her aunt would be sorry of course
4,6,-1,and his father
5,6,-1,perhaps
6,5,-1,would be angry
7,6,-1,but the sorrow and 5 would be only for a little while
8,6,-1,Then Martin and she would live happily together always happily because they were both sensible people
9,6,-1,and her own standard of fidelity and trust was
10,6,-1,she supposed
11,6,-1,also his .
1284 11
 (3, 3),
1,6,-1,And yet
2,6,-1,as he had also learned
3,1,-1,she was ashamed of the passion that at times swept and dominated her
4,6,-1,This irritated Cowperwood
5,6,-1,as it would always irritate any strong
6,6,-1,acquisitive
7,6,-1,direct seeing temperament
8,6,-1,While he had no desire to acquaint the whole world with his feelings
9,6,-1,why should there be concealment between them
10,6,-1,or at least mental evasion of a fact which physically she subscribed to
11,6,-1,Why do one thing and think another

 (2, 3),
1,6,-1,Nasib then returned to inform us that the king had heard our complaint
2,1,-1,and was sorry for it
3,6,-1,but said he could not interfere with the rights of his officers
4,6,-1,He did not wish himself to take anything from us
5,6,-1,and hoped we would come on to him as soon as we had satisfied his officers with the trifle they wanted
6,6,-1,Virembo then sent us some pombe by his officers
7,6,-1,and begged us to have patience

5,6,-1,"  Ah
6,6,-1,"   she answered
7,4,-1,"  I fear it will be an evil day for us when you took him home
8,6,-1,"   She had a good chance to say
9,6,-1,"  I told you so
10,6,-1,"   when the rogue eloped with the best of their silver . Not only is FL

 (3, 5),
1,6,-1,And then she came to the matter of a train gown
2,6,-1,Kathleen laid out five
3,0,-1,for Aileen had come into the joy and honor of these things recently
4,6,-1,and she had
5,6,-1,with the permission of her mother and father
6,6,-1,indulged herself to the full
7,6,-1,She studied a golden-yellow silk
8,6,-1,with cream lace shoulder straps
9,6,-1,and some gussets of garnet beads in the train that shimmered delightfully
10,6,-1,but set it aside .

1,0,-1,He wasnt particularly bothered if Gretel was being sent away because she was a Hopeless Case and caused nothing but trouble for him
2,6,-1,But it seemed a little unfair that they all had to go with her .
2542 1
 (1, 1),
1,4,-1,A profound calm , a frightful , silent expectancy had spread over the city  .  Many of the heavy citizens , emasculated by commerce , anxiously awaited the conquerors , trembling lest their roasting spits or kitchen knives be considered arms  .

2,6,-1,Cowperwood and later with Mrs
3,6,-1,Seneca Davis
4,6,-1,and still later with Mrs
5,6,-1,Martyn Walker
6,6,-1,Cowperwood had occasion to look at Aileen often
7,0,-1,and each time that he did so there swept over him a sense of great vigor there
8,6,-1,of beautiful if raw
9,6,-1,dynamic energy that to him was irresistible and especially so to-night
10,6,-1,She was so young
11,6,-1,She was beautiful
12,6,-1,this girl
13,6,-1,and in spite of his wife 's repeated derogatory comments he felt that she was nearer to his clear

15,6,-1,unblinking attitude than any one whom he had yet seen in the form of woman .

2,1,-1,Joel was deeply hurt by his mothers words
3,6,-1,and by being hit
4,6,-1,but he was determined not to let his emotional wound show
5,6,-1,and instead became even more superior and demeaning .
2455 20
 (20, 12),
1,6,-1,"  Well
2,6,-1,tuck in
3,6,-1,"   said Fledge
4,6,-1,taking a big mouthful of grass
5,6,-1,Then he raised his head
6,6,-1,still chewing and with bits of grass sticking out on each side of his mouth like whiskers
7,6,-1,and said
8,6,-1,"  Come on
9,6,-1,you two
10,6,-1,dont be shy

1,6,-1,The captain shook hands with me cordially
2,6,-1,pooh poohing the loss of the boat as an unavoidable incident of the trade
3,0,-1,but expressing his heart-felt delight at getting us all back safe
4,6,-1,The whale we had killed was ample compensation for the loss of several boats
5,6,-1,though such was the vigour with which the sharks were going for him
6,6,-1,that it was deemed advisable to cut in at once
7,6,-1,working all night .

 (1, 1),
1,4,-1,But it was Mr Warlock 's reality of which she was afraid
2,6,-1,As he continued his prayer she felt all her old terror return
3,6,-1,that terror that she had known on the night her father died
4,6,-1,during the hours that she had watched beside his dead body
5,6,-1,at the moment when she had first arrived at the house in London
6,6,-1,during her first visit to the Chapel
7,6,-1,when she had said good night to her aunt before going out with Uncle Mathew

 (4, 4),
1,6,-1,He raised a gigantic tail on high
2,6,-1,threshing the water with deafening blows
3,6,-1,rolling at the same time from side to side until the surrounding sea was white with froth
4,5,-1,I felt in an agony lest we should be crushed under one of those fearful strokes
5,6,-1,for Mr
6,6,-1,Count appeared to be oblivious of possible danger
7,6,-1,although we seemed to be now drifting back on to the writhing leviathan
8,6,-1,In the agitated condition of the sea
9,6,-1,it was a task of no ordinary difficulty to un ship the tall mast
10,6,-1,which was of course the first thing to be done .

1,6,-1,Her face was white
2,6,-1,with the effect of a chalk drawing into which live
3,6,-1,black
4,6,-1,burning eyes had been stuck
5,4,-1,But it was none of these things that frightened Maggie
6,6,-1,It was the expression somewhere in the mouth
7,6,-1,in the eyes
8,6,-1,in the pale bony hands
9,6,-1,that spoke of some meeting with a torturer whose powers were almost omniscient almost
10,6,-1,but not quite .
1880 4
 (3, 3),
1,6,-1,not only on his own account but on hers and his father 's
2,6,-1,In her tenderness she had not told him that the real reason was his instability of purpose
3,4,-1,4ing to wound his pride
4,6,-1,she had put it solely on the ground of his settling down to some work .

6,0,-1,delighted that he wasnt the only boy who 'd been forced to move .
2434 13
 (11, 12),
1,6,-1,From this state of humiliation
2,6,-1,she was roused
3,6,-1,at the end of ten minutes
4,6,-1,to a more pleasant feeling
5,6,-1,by seeing
6,6,-1,not Mr Thorpe
7,6,-1,but Mr Tilney
8,6,-1,within three yards of the place where they sat
9,6,-1,he seemed to be moving that way
10,6,-1,but he did not see her
11,0,-1,and therefore the smile and the blush
12,6,-1,which his sudden reappearance raised in Catherine
13,6,-1,passed away without sullying her heroic importance .

 (16, 10),
1,6,-1,"  No trouble

21,6,-1,in his natural tone
22,6,-1,"  But some emotion must appear to be raised by your reply
23,6,-1,and 3 is more easily assumed
24,6,-1,and not less reasonable than any other

4,6,-1,The girls had never been called angel children before
5,0,-1,and thought it very agreeable
6,6,-1,especially Jo
7,6,-1,who had been considered a  ' sancho ' ever since she was born
8,6,-1,That was a very happy breakfast
9,6,-1,though they didnt get any of it
10,6,-1,And when they went away
11,6,-1,leaving comfort behind
12,6,-1,I think there were not in all the city four merrier people than the hungry little girls who gave away their breakfasts and contented themselves with bread and milk on Christmas morning .
635 7
 (4, 4),
1,6,-1,Bruno got to the end of his sentence and realized that his voice had gone very quiet
2,6,-1,These were things that Shmuel had told him
3,6,-1,but for some reason he had not really understood at the time how sad that must have  made his friend
4,1,-1,When Bruno said them out loud himself he felt terrible that he had not tried to say anything to cheer Shmuel up and instead had started talking about something silly
5,6,-1,like exploring
6,6,-1,i 'll say sorry for that tomorrow
7,6,-1,he told himself .

4,6,-1,recognising in me
5,6,-1,as they said
6,6,-1,a  "  personification of their sultan
7,6,-1,"   and therefore considering what they were doing only due to my rank
8,1,-1,They regretted with myself that Snay was so hot-headed
9,6,-1,for they themselves thought a treaty of peace would have been the best thing for them
10,6,-1,for they were more than half ruined already
11,6,-1,and saw no hope for the future
12,6,-1,Then
13,6,-1,turning to geography
14,6,-1,I told Abdulla all I had written and lectured in England concerning his stories about navigators on the N'yanza
15,6,-1,which I explained must be the Nile

4,6,-1,they broke water from sounding right among us
5,3,-1,It was a considerable surprise
6,6,-1,but we were all ready
7,6,-1,and before they had spouted twice
8,6,-1,three boats were fast
9,6,-1,only myself keeping out
10,6,-1,in accordance with my instructions .

6,6,-1,He 's only nine
7,6,-1,' oh
8,6,-1,will you be quiet please
9,6,-1,' shouted Bruno
10,5,-1,staring at his sister in irritation
11,6,-1,It was bad enough having to come out here and ask for a favour from Lieutenant Kotler
12,6,-1,but it only  made things worse when his own sister teased him all the way through it .
520 8
 (2, 5),
1,6,-1,Just at that moment there was a creak outside in the hallway and Bruno looked up to see the door of Mother and Father 's room opening slightly
2,4,-1,He froze
3,6,-1,unable to move for a moment
4,6,-1,Mother was still downstairs
5,6,-1,which meant that Father was in there and he might have heard everything that Bruno had just said
6,6,-1,He watched the door
7,6,-1,hardly daring to breathe
8,6,-1,wondering whether Father might come through it and take him downstairs for a serious talking to .
391 9
 (1, 6),(9, 6),
1,4,-1,Deeply moved by the sight of this despair
2,6,-1,the servants held their breath
3,6,-1,wondering how it would all end
4,6,-1,It ended suddenly
5,6,-1,The girl sprang from her knees
6,6,-1,as if a gleam of hope had darted through her heart
7,6,-1,"  A physician
8,6,-1,"   she said
9,4,-1,eagerly .
517 3
 (3, 2),
1,6,-1,Bruno had a pain in his stomach and he could feel something growing inside him
2,6,-1,something that when it worked its way up from the lowest depths inside him to the outside world would either make him shout and scream that the whole thing was wrong and unfair and a big mistake for which somebody would pay one of these days
3,1,-1,or just make him burst into tears instead .
1752 10
 (5, 4),
1,6,-1,however
2,6,-1,resulted in their getting a severe dressing down in the forecastle
3,6,-1,where good order was now kept
4,6,-1,There had been no need for interference on the part of the officers
5,0,-1,which I was glad to see
6,6,-1,remembering what would have happened under such circumstances not long ago
7,6,-1,Being short-handed
8,6,-1,the captain engaged a number of friendly islanders for a limited period
9,6,-1,on the understanding that they were to be discharged at their native place
10,6,-1,Vau Vau .
1120 9
 (2, 2),
1,6,-1,"  My son
2,4,-1,the great thing now is to arrange how you can best carry off this treasure as secretly as possible for fear of losing it
3,6,-1,There are no olives in the Ebony Island
4,6,-1,and those imported from here fetch a high price
5,6,-1,As you know
6,6,-1,I have a good stock of the olives which grew in this garden
7,6,-1,Now you must take fifty jars
8,6,-1,fill each half full of gold dust and fill them up with the olives
9,6,-1,We will then have them taken on board ship when you embark .  "
570 10
 (6, 4),
1,6,-1,' because she 's the maid
2,6,-1,' said Gretel
3,6,-1,staring at him
4,6,-1,' that 's what she 's here for
5,6,-1,' that 's not what she 's here for
6,5,-1,' shouted Bruno
7,6,-1,standing up and marching over to her
8,6,-1,' she 's not just here to do things for us all the time
9,6,-1,you know
10,6,-1,Especially things that we can do ourselves . '
2379 10
 (5, 4),
1,6,-1,When the hour of departure drew near
2,6,-1,the maternal anxiety of Mrs
3,6,-1,Morland will be naturally supposed to be most severe
4,6,-1,A thousand alarming presentiment of evil to her beloved Catherine from this terrific separation must oppress her heart with 1
5,1,-1,and drown her in tears for the last day or two of their being together
6,6,-1,and advice of the most important and applicable nature must of course flow from her wise lips in their parting conference in her closet
7,6,-1,Cautions against the violence of such noblemen and baronets as delight in forcing young ladies away to some remote farm house
8,6,-1,must
9,6,-1,at such a moment
10,6,-1,relieve the fulness of her heart .
524 5
 (3, 1),
1,6,-1,He ran into Gretel 's room without knocking and discovered her placing her civilization of dolls on various shelves around the room
2,6,-1,' what are you doing in here
3,5,-1,' she shouted
4,6,-1,spinning round
5,6,-1,dont you know you dont enter a lady 's room without knocking
1756 7
 (4, 4),(4, 5),
1,6,-1,At that last titanic effort of his he had rushed downward with such terrific force that
2,6,-1,striking his head on the bottom
3,6,-1,he had broken his neck
4,1,-1,I felt very grieved that we had lost the chance of securing him
5,6,-1,but it was perfectly certain that before we could get help to raise him
6,6,-1,all that would be left of his skeleton would be quite valueless to us
7,6,-1,So with such patience as we could command we waited near the entrance until the receding ebb made it possible for us to emerge once more into the blessed light of day .
1806 11
 (9, 9),
1,6,-1,The truth of Mr
2,6,-1,Count 's forecast was verified to the hilt
3,6,-1,for we found that the captain was so badly bruised about
4,6,-1,the body that he was unable to move
5,6,-1,while one of the hands
6,6,-1,a Portuguese
7,6,-1,was injured internally
8,6,-1,and seemed very bad indeed
9,1,-1,Had any one told us that morning that we should be sorry to see Captain Slocum with sore bones
10,6,-1,we should have scoffed at the notion
11,6,-1,and some of us would probably have said that we should like to have the opportunity of making him smart .
662 5
 (4, 4),
1,6,-1,Bruno had the shampoo as well
2,6,-1,but then Father decided that the best thing was for him to start afresh and he got a razor and shaved all Bruno 's hair off
3,6,-1,which  made Bruno cry
4,2,-1,It didnt take long and he hated seeing all his hair float down from his head and land on the floor at his feet
5,6,-1,but Father said it had to be done .
715 9
 (6, 7),
1,6,-1,Next morning
2,6,-1,then
3,6,-1,after giving the Tots over in charge of some men to escort them on to Kaze quietly
4,6,-1,I set our myself with a dozen men
5,6,-1,and the following evening I put up with Musa
6,4,-1,who told me Baraka had just left without one man all his slaves having become afraid to go
7,6,-1,since the news of the Arab alliance had reached Kaze
8,6,-1,Suwarora had ordered his subjects to run up a line of bomas to protect his frontier
9,6,-1,and had proclaimed his intention to kill every coast man who dared attempt to enter Usui .
99 9
 (9, 8),
1,6,-1,But as soon as they checked in
2,6,-1,he braced himself
3,6,-1,and sure enough his phone rang a minute later
4,6,-1,I hate my room
5,6,-1,Jobs declared
6,6,-1,It 's a piece of shit
7,6,-1,let 's go
8,6,-1,So Ive gathered his luggage and went to the front desk
9,3,-1,where Jobs bluntly told the shocked clerk what he thought .
2426 16
 (15, 15),
1,6,-1,"  I am very glad to hear you say so
2,6,-1,she is just the kind of young woman I could wish to see you attached to
3,6,-1,she has so much good sense
4,6,-1,and is so thoroughly unaffected and amiable
5,6,-1,I always wanted you to know her
6,6,-1,and she seems very fond of you
7,6,-1,She said the highest things in your praise that could possibly be
8,6,-1,and the praise of such a girl as Miss Thorpe even you
9,6,-1,Catherine
10,6,-1,"   taking her hand with affection
11,6,-1,"  may be proud of
12,6,-1,"  Indeed I am
13,6,-1,"   she replied
14,6,-1,"  I love her exceedingly
15,0,-1,and am delighted to find that you like her too
16,6,-1,You hardly mentioned anything of her when you wrote to me after your visit there .  "
427 19
 (3, 3),
1,6,-1,Forward the money without delay
2,6,-1,I fear the poor boy is greatly annoyed by his creditors
3,0,-1,Yesterday I had the happiness of seeing him in the Rue de Helder
4,6,-1,and I found him looking pale and careworn
5,6,-1,When you send him this money
6,6,-1,forward at the same time a letter of fatherly advice
7,6,-1,It is true
8,6,-1,he ought to work and win an honorable position for himself
9,6,-1,but think of the dangers and temptation that beset him
10,6,-1,alone and friendless
11,6,-1,in this corrupt city
12,6,-1,There
13,6,-1,my dear lady
14,6,-1,your letter ended
15,6,-1,but the name and address were given
16,6,-1,and it was easy enough to understand it
17,6,-1,You remember
18,6,-1,perhaps
19,6,-1,a little incident that occurred after your return .
1171 17
 (16, 17),
1,6,-1,He was
2,6,-1,to look at
3,6,-1,a phlegmatic type of man short
4,6,-1,stout
5,6,-1,wrinkled about the eyes
6,6,-1,rather protuberant as to stomach
7,6,-1,red-necked
8,6,-1,red-faced
9,6,-1,the least bit popeyed
10,6,-1,but shrewd
11,6,-1,kindly
12,6,-1,good natured
13,6,-1,and witty
14,6,-1,He had
15,6,-1,because of his naturally common-sense ideas and rather pleasing disposition built up a sound and successful business here
16,0,-1,He was getting strong in years and would gladly have welcomed the hearty cooperation of his son
17,6,-1,if the latter had been entirely suited to the business .
1934 7
 (2, 3),
1,6,-1,I sent Bombay with the compass
2,0,-1,much to the delight of the king
3,6,-1,who no sooner saw it than he jumped and woh wohed with intense excitement at the treasure he had gained
4,6,-1,said it was the greatest present Bana had ever given him
5,6,-1,for it was the thing by which he found out all the roads and countries it was
6,6,-1,in fact
7,6,-1,half his knowledge
1086 6
 (2, 2),
1,6,-1,When she was living with the aunts she had not minded very seriously the criticisms made upon her
2,1,-1,she had indeed been disappointed when Aunt Anne had not admired her new dress
3,6,-1,and she had hated Amy Warlock 's rudeness
4,6,-1,but that was because Martin had been involved
5,6,-1,This new sensitiveness worried her
6,6,-1,she hated to care whether people laughed at the way she came into a room or whether she expressed foolish opinions about books and pictures .
2396 18
 (5, 5),
1,6,-1,Mrs
2,6,-1,Allen immediately recognized the features of a former school fellow and intimate
3,6,-1,whom she had seen only once since their respective marriages
4,6,-1,and that many years ago
5,0,-1,Their joy on this meeting was very great
6,6,-1,as well it might
7,6,-1,since they had been contented to know nothing of each other for the last fifteen years
8,6,-1,Compliments on good looks now passed
9,6,-1,and
10,6,-1,after observing how time had slipped away since they were last together
11,6,-1,how little they had thought of meeting in Bath
12,6,-1,and what a pleasure it was to see an old friend
13,6,-1,they proceeded to make inquiries and give intelligence as to their families
14,6,-1,sisters
15,6,-1,and cousins
16,6,-1,talking both together
17,6,-1,far more ready to give than to receive information
18,6,-1,and each hearing very little of what the other said .

1,6,-1,' nay
2,6,-1,an it were so at home
3,6,-1,' said Baird
4,6,-1,' i had as lief stay here as where a man is not free to fight out his own feud
5,2,-1,Even this sackless fellow thought it shame to see two honest men baulked . '
1158 4
 (2, 1),
1,6,-1,Being ambitious to get ahead socially and financially
2,4,-1,he was very careful of whom or with whom he talked
3,6,-1,He was as much afraid of Agatha 's she had expressing a rabid or unpopular political or social opinion as he was of being seen with an evil character
4,6,-1,though he had really no opinion of great political significance to express .
2394 14
 (14, 11),
1,6,-1,"  Have you been to the theatre
2,6,-1,"   "  Yes
3,6,-1,sir
4,6,-1,I was at the play on Tuesday
5,6,-1,To the concert
6,6,-1,"   "  Yes
7,6,-1,sir
8,6,-1,on Wednesday
9,6,-1,And are you altogether pleased with Bath
10,6,-1,"   "  Yes   I like it very well
11,6,-1,Now I must give one smirk
12,6,-1,and then we may be rational again
13,6,-1,Catherine turned away her head
14,0,-1,not knowing whether she might venture to laugh
845 13
 (2, 3),(2, 4),
1,6,-1,I then ( 16th ) very much wished to go and see the escape of the Mwerango river
2,2,-1,as I still felt a little sceptical as to its origin
3,6,-1,whether or not it came off those smaller lakes I had seen on the road the day before I crossed the river
4,6,-1,but no one would listen to my project
5,6,-1,They all said I must have the king 's sanction first
6,6,-1,else people
7,6,-1,from not knowing my object
8,6,-1,would accuse me of practising witchcraft
9,6,-1,and would tell their king so
10,6,-1,They still all maintained that the river did come out of the lake
11,6,-1,and said
12,6,-1,if I liked to ask the king 's leave to visit the spot
13,6,-1,then they would go and show it me .
1656 6
 (2, 2),
1,6,-1,So fiercely leapt these sons of Troy to meet war hardened Greeks
2,0,-1,The black Fates joyed to see Their conflict
3,6,-1,Ares laughed
4,6,-1,Enyo yelled Horribly
5,6,-1,Loud their glancing armour clanged :  They stabbed
6,6,-1,they hewed down hosts of foes untold With irresistible hands .
1285 25
 (11, 10),
1,6,-1,At the same time
2,6,-1,in contemplating his wife in connection with all this he had many qualms
3,6,-1,some emotional
4,6,-1,some financial
5,6,-1,While she had yielded to his youthful enthusiasm for her after her husband 's death
6,6,-1,he had only since learned that she was a natural conservator of public morals the cold purity of the snowdrift in so far as the world might see
7,6,-1,combined at times with the murky mood of the wanton
8,6,-1,And yet
9,6,-1,as he had also learned
10,6,-1,she was ashamed of the passion that at times swept and dominated her
11,5,-1,This irritated Cowperwood
12,6,-1,as it would always irritate any strong
13,6,-1,acquisitive
14,6,-1,direct seeing temperament
15,6,-1,While he had no desire to acquaint the whole world with his feelings
16,6,-1,why should there be concealment between them
17,6,-1,or at least mental evasion of a fact which physically she subscribed to
18,6,-1,Why do one thing and think another
19,6,-1,To be sure
20,6,-1,she was devoted to him in her quiet way
21,6,-1,not passionately ( as he looked back he could not say that she had ever been that )
22,6,-1,but intellectually
23,6,-1,Duty
24,6,-1,as she understood it
25,6,-1,played a great part in this .
744 11
 (5, 5),
1,6,-1,It may well be believed that the prince felt in despair at this fresh misfortune
2,6,-1,which obliged him to spend another year in a strange and distasteful country
3,6,-1,Moreover
4,6,-1,he had once more lost the Princess Badoura 's talisman
5,4,-1,which he feared he might never see again
6,6,-1,There was nothing left for him but to hire the garden as the old man had done
7,6,-1,and to live on in the cottage
8,6,-1,As he could not well cultivate the garden by himself
9,6,-1,he engaged a lad to help him
10,6,-1,and to secure the rest of the treasure he put the remaining gold dust into fifty more jars
11,6,-1,filling them up with olives so as to have them ready for transport .
1748 7
 (5, 5),
1,6,-1,Consequently the state of the ship was filthy
2,6,-1,nor could all our efforts keep her clean
3,6,-1,This farmyard condition of things was permitted to continue for about a week
4,6,-1,when the officers got so tired of it
5,5,-1,and the captain so annoyed at the frequent loss of fowls by their flying overboard
6,6,-1,that the edict went forth to feed the foremast hands on poultry till further orders
7,6,-1,Great was our delight at the news .
150 10
 (9, 10),
1,6,-1,Now
2,6,-1,the real facts of the case were these though I did not find them out at the time :   Baraka had bought some slaves with my effects
3,6,-1,and he had had a fight with some of my men because they tampered with his temporary wife a princess he had picked up in Phunze
4,6,-1,To obtain her hand he had given ten necklaces of MY beads to her mother
5,6,-1,and had agreed to the condition that he should keep the girl during the journey
6,6,-1,and after it was over
7,6,-1,and he took her home
8,6,-1,he would
9,0,-1,if his wife pleased him
10,6,-1,give her mother ten necklaces more .
680 2
 (2, 2),
1,6,-1,All hearts stood still In dumb amazement
2,0,-1,But the tireless winds Sighing set hero Memnon 's giant corpse Down by the deep flow of aesopus ' stream .
109 9
 (7, 7),
1,6,-1,and judging from the progressive state of the world
2,6,-1,one is led to suppose that the African must soon either step out from his darkness
3,6,-1,or be superseded by a being superior to himself
4,6,-1,Could a government be formed for them like ours in India
5,6,-1,they would be saved
6,6,-1,but without it
7,4,-1,I fear there is very little chance
8,6,-1,for at present the African neither can help himself nor will he be helped about by others
9,6,-1,because his country is in such a constant state of turmoil he has too much anxiety on hand looking out for his food to think of anything else
879 4
 (2, 2),
1,6,-1,She felt pleasure in his company
2,4,-1,for the first time since her father 's death she was a little frightened and uneasy
3,6,-1,She might even have gone to him and cried on his shoulder had he given her any encouragement
4,6,-1,but he did not speak to her except to say that he had already eaten .
1009 9
 (4, 7),
1,6,-1,"  No
2,6,-1,"   answered Maggie
3,6,-1,"  It is n't that exactly
4,1,-1,im not happy at home
5,6,-1,but I think that 's my fault
6,6,-1,My aunts are very good
7,6,-1,But I want to be free
8,6,-1,It is all very religious where I am
9,6,-1,and they want me to believe in their religion .
1749 15
 (9, 8),
1,6,-1,You WANT somethin' to growl about
2,6,-1,you do
3,6,-1,"   Well
4,6,-1,Cap'n George
5,6,-1,"   said one of the men
6,6,-1,"  you shorely dont think we k'n eat shells
7,6,-1,do yer
8,6,-1,"   Just then I caught sight of the kid 's contents
9,5,-1,and could hardly restrain my indignation
10,6,-1,For in a dirty heap
11,6,-1,the sight of which might have pleased an Esquimaux
12,6,-1,but was certainly enough to 2 any civilized man
13,6,-1,lay the calipee
14,6,-1,or under shell of the turtle
15,6,-1,hacked into irregular blocks .
2056 23
 (10, 9),(10, 10),
1,6,-1,Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute
2,6,-1,trying to make out which were the two sides of it
3,6,-1,and as it was perfectly round
4,6,-1,she found this a very difficult question  .  However
5,6,-1,at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go
6,6,-1,and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand
7,6,-1,nd now which is which
8,6,-1,' she said to herself
9,6,-1,and nibbled a little of the right-hand bit to try the effect :  the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin :  it had struck her foot
10,4,-1,She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change
11,6,-1,but she felt that there was no time to be lost
12,6,-1,as she was shrinking rapidly
13,6,-1,so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit . Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot
14,6,-1,that there was hardly room to open her mouth
15,6,-1,but she did it at last
16,6,-1,and managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit Come
17,6,-1,my head 's free at last
18,6,-1,' said Alice in a tone of delight
19,6,-1,which changed into alarm in another moment
20,6,-1,when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found :  all she could see
21,6,-1,when she looked down
22,6,-1,was an immense length of neck
23,6,-1,which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her
2050 21
 (8, 8),
1,6,-1,How 3d he 'll be when he finds out who I am
2,6,-1,But i 'd better take him his fan and gloves that is
3,6,-1,if I can find them
4,6,-1,As she said this
5,6,-1,she came upon a neat little house
6,6,-1,on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name  WRABBIT engraved upon it . She went in without knocking
7,6,-1,and hurried upstairs
8,4,-1,in great 4 lest she should meet the real Mary Ann
9,6,-1,and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves  How queer it seems
10,6,-1,' Alice said to herself
11,6,-1,to be going messages for a rabbit
12,6,-1,I suppose Dinah'll be sending me on messages next
13,6,-1,' And she began fancying the sort of thing that would happen :    "  Miss Alice
14,6,-1,Come here directly
15,6,-1,and get ready for your walk
16,6,-1,"    "  Coming in a minute
17,6,-1,nurse
18,6,-1,But i 've got to see that the mouse does n't get out
19,6,-1,Only I dont think
20,6,-1,' Alice went on
21,6,-1,that they 'd let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people
2692 5
 (4, 4),(4, 5),
1,6,-1,Mr Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room
2,6,-1,he was lively and unreserved
3,6,-1,danced every dance
4,5,-1,was angry that the ball closed so early
5,6,-1,and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield .
1148 6
 (2, 2),
1,6,-1,The Caliph
2,3,-1,much surprised at this request
3,6,-1,replied gently :    "  My good man
4,6,-1,that which you ask is impossible
5,6,-1,Of what use would my alms be if I treated you so ill
6,6,-1,"    And as he spoke he tried to loosen the grasp of the blind beggar .
1683 6
 (4, 4),
1,6,-1,An Oxford man
2,6,-1,who spoke very much against the height of the now old clergy
3,6,-1,for putting out many of the religious fellows of Colleges
4,5,-1,and inveighing against them for their being drunk
5,6,-1,It being post night
6,6,-1,I wrote to my Lord to give him notice that all things are well .

3,6,-1,' i want to read my book
4,6,-1,' well
5,6,-1,why dont you lie down and close your eyes and let your imaginary friend read it to you
6,6,-1,' said Gretel
7,0,-1,delighted with herself now because she had something on him and she wasnt going to let it drop in a hurry
8,6,-1,' save you a job . '
