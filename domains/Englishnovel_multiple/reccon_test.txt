7,0,6,that sounds good . I'm going to start with an Italian tiramisu .
8,0,6,do you want to try some of my yogurt . It's a favorite everyday dessert in Greece .

3,6,6,Well  yes  we are  madam . The shop shuts down in five minutes .
4,6,6,I shall not keep you long then . It was about some saucepans you had in your window last week .
5,6,6,Last week  madam ? I really can't remember which ones you mean . What were they like ?
6,0,6,Oh  they were lovely . Sort of imitation wood  dark brown color  country-style you know  and the lids  if I remember rightly  they had a sort of leaf pattern  or was it flowers ?
7,6,6,That's strange . I don't recognize any of the ones we had from that description . Are you sure they were in this shop ?
8,6,6,Oh  you must know the ones I mean . They were on sale  a real bargain . Reduced to a quarter of the original price . I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw them .
9,1,6,I am afraid the sales are over now  madam . And you know we all sold out of the saucepans .
10,6,6,I don't think you did  you know . My neighbor told me she saw some here only yesterday .
11,6,6,Well  it's all new stock in the window now .
12,6,6,May I just have a look  to see if there is anything else ?
13,6,6,Eh  well  madam  as you know we are closing .
14,6,6,Yes  yes  I am sorry I won't keep you . It must get on your nerves when customers come in right at closing time . But they were such beautiful saucepans . I ' d have bought them if I had made up my mind on the spot .
15,6,6,Perhaps madam  if you come back tomorrow  I could show you the whole range of kitchen ware . And there are still one or two things at the sale price .
16,0,6,Oh  look ! That was the one there . That is the sort of thing I was looking for . But it's not quite the color .
17,6,6,That might be the artificial lighting  madam . Of course  if you could come back in daylight  you might find it ' s exactly what you are looking for .
18,0,6,There it is . That is the pattern ! The set behind you . Thank goodness  they haven't been sold . And thank you so much for being so patient with me . Yes  those are the ones .

2,6,6,What ?
3,6,6,I went down to change some money  right ?
4,6,6,Yes . We need some . How much did you change ?
5,6,6,I wanted to change around 5000 dollars . And you know the exchange rate .
6,6,6,Yes  it's about 35 pesos for every Taiwan dollar  right ?
7,6,6,Not today .
8,3,6,What do you mean ?
9,6,6,I went into the bank with my money  and I looked at the exchange board . At first I couldn't believe it . I thought I was reading the board wrong or something .
10,3,6,Why ?
11,3,6,Because the board said 60 pesos for every Taiwan dollar .
12,6,6,Sixty ? That's too much . How can that be ?
13,6,6,I thought it was wrong too . It didn't make sense .
14,3,6,Just two days ago it was 35 . How can it be 60 ?
15,6,6,So  I went up to the teller and started to exchange the money . And it's true . They really gave me sixty pesos for the dollar .
16,3,6,That's amazing ! Really ? How could it change so much in two days ?

6,6,6,You know  my dad had scrambled eggs every morning for twenty years . It drove my mom crazy !
7,6,6,You know what really drives me crazy ? When I ask for soft boiled eggs  and they overcook them  so they come out hard boiled ! How can you dipyour toast into a hard boiled egg ?

7,6,6,How about this scarf  these earrings  AMD an anklet ?
8,6,6,That might be going overboard a bit . How about just that scarf with a bracelet ?

13,6,6,The leopard print sounds fabulous . Are they a name brand ?
14,6,6,No  they ' re a Prada knock-off for 1/10 of the price of the real thing .

4,6,6,You should get plenty of sleep .
5,1,6,I drink a lot of wine .
6,6,6,If I were you  I wouldn't drink too much .
7,1,6,I often feel so tired .

2,6,6,Sure  but I don't drink much . So I don't know what to order .
3,6,6,So how about an aperitif ?
4,6,6,It sounds good . I'd like to start with a Compare .
5,6,6,Stirred or shaken ?
6,6,6,Stirred will be fine .
7,6,6,Here you are .

10,6,6,Can you recommend one ?
11,6,6,Try a Stinger . It has lime juice and grenadine over ice .
12,0,6,It sounds interesting . I'll take one .

1,0,6,Matthew ? Hi !
2,0,6,Steve ! Haven't seen you in ages ! How long's it been ?
3,0,6,It's got to be almost a year now .
4,0,6,How have you been ?
5,0,6,I'm pretty good . I've been looking for a place to live recently . My lease runs out next month and I don't want to renew it .
6,6,6,Yeah  I remember the neighborhood . Have you found a place yet ?
7,6,6,Not yet . But I am still looking through the classifieds . Wish me luck .
8,0,6,Well  maybe I can help . Remember my neighbor ?
9,6,6,Mrs . Thou ?
10,0,6,Yes  her daughter's having a baby  so she's moving in with her to help out . I think if you are interested  you can come over and have a look .
11,0,6,Great . It's a lovely neighborhood . And it would be nice to be neighbors again . It would be just like the old days !
12,0,6,I'll ask Mrs . Thou when she's available to show the apartment and let you know . Has your number changed ?

1,6,6,Listen  Karen  I need your help . I don't know anyone here yet .
2,0,6,I'm glad to help you . What's wrong ?
3,6,6,My mother-in-law just went into the hospital in L . A . Hank and I will be flying there tonight .
4,1,6,I'm sorry to hear it . What's wrong with her ?
5,6,6,Doctors aren't sure yet . But the real problem is Suzy . She has a bad cold  and we don't want to take her with us . But we don't know who can stay with her .
6,6,6,You need a babysitter .
7,6,6,Yes  I'd ask Jill  the girl I've had before  but I need someone overnight . Maybe even for two nights .
8,6,6,I could have Suzy stay at my place .
9,6,6,I don't want to do that to you  Karen .
10,6,6,Why not ?
11,6,6,Your own kids would get Suzy's cold . I think it would be better to have a good babysitter here . But I don't know who to ask . I need someone more mature than Jill . It might even be for two or three days .
12,6,6,I know who we can ask . There is a girl I know  Sara Ralston . She is 17  and she will usually take this kind of job . I know her from my church  and I trust her completely .
13,6,6,I'd like to talk with her . This is short notice  I know . But Hank and I are leaving tonight .
14,6,6,I'll get you her number . I hope she can do it . She is very responsible .
15,0,6,I'm glad you know someone . I knew you would be the best person to ask about this . I don't want to insult Jill or her mother . I think Jill maybe could do it . But I'd rather have someone a little older .
16,6,6,I'll go home and get Sara's number . I'll call her first myself .
17,0,6,Great . Then call me and let me know if she's free .

1,6,6,Wow ! It's hot today ! Do you want to get an ice cream cone ?
2,6,6,No Let's go to an ice cream parlor ! They have way more flavors to choose from there . I feel like having something special like Neapolitan ice cream .
3,6,6,What's that ?
4,6,6,It's three different flavors mixed together . Chocolate  strawberry and something green with candied fruit .
5,6,6,Do they have ice cream bars . frozen yogurt or frozen chocolate mousse ?
6,0,6,Absolutely ! They also have real Italian Galatian and French sorbets . They do a great baked Alaska .
7,6,6,Maybe a vanilla ice cream milkshake would be good . What's your favorite flavor ?
8,0,6,Well ... l like the traditional flavors like rum raisin  butter pecan . maple walnut  strawberry  chocolate and vanilla . But now there are some new flavors from Asia like green tea and durian .
9,0,6,God ! Even talking about it makes me feel like l'm gaining weight !

2,6,6,Come on  don ' t be so dramatic ! I ' m sure everything is going to work out just fine .
3,5,6,You think so ? Oh  no ! How can he do this to me ? I ' m sure he ' s cheating on me ! Why else wouldn ' t he call ?
4,6,6,But  you two are on a break . Theoretically he can do whatever he likes .
5,1,6,He ' s the love of my life ! I ' Ve really messed this up .
6,6,6,Come on  hon . Pull yourself together . It ' s going to be alright .
7,1,6,But I ... I still love him ! And it ' s all my fault ! I can ' t believe how immature and selfish I was being . I mean  he is a firefighter  it ' s not like he can just leave someone in a burning building and meet me for dinner . I ' Ve totally messed this up !
8,6,6,You know what  Veronica  I think you should make the first step . I ' m sure he ' ll forgive you ...

5,6,6,are you available on Sunday ?
6,6,6,yes  that's my only day off until Thursday .
7,6,6,ok  well  my friends and I are planning on going to the beach on Sunday . We tend to leave around noon whenever we go anywhere  so you could still sleep in . Do you want to come with us ?
8,0,6,that'd be fantastic ! Which beach are you going to ?
9,6,6,it's a quiet beach just about an hour outside of the city .
10,6,6,what should I bring with me ?
11,6,6,we've got plenty of inflatables  but if you want to sit on a chair  you'll have to bring your own sunlounger .
12,6,6,I can just use my beach towel . I love lazing around in the sun .
13,6,6,do you like surfing ?
14,6,6,I've actually never tired . Do you have a surfboard ?

16,6,6,I can't wait ! It sounds like we're going to have a great time . How much money should I bring ?
17,6,6,you'll just need roughly $ 10 for food and gas money . My friend is driving  so we usually all chip in a few dollars for gas money .
18,6,6,ok  where and when should I meet you ?

2,1,6,Someone has stolen my gold necklace .
3,6,6,I am sorry to hear about that . Would you mind coming with me to my office and tell me exactly what happened here ?
4,6,6,Of course not .
5,6,6,Are you sure that it isn't somewhere in your room ?
6,6,6,Yes  I've looked everywhere in my room and I can ' t find it .
7,6,6,Ok  when and where did you last see it ?
8,6,6,Last night on the dresser . I took it off before I went to the shower  and forgot to put it back on after the shower . And this morning I left the hotel in a hurry without wearing it .
9,6,6,Are you sure you didn't wear it this morning ?
10,6,6,Yes  I am positive .
11,6,6,Did you remember to lock your door before you left then ?
12,5,6,Yes  I think I did . It has to be one of your maids who took it . I want my necklace back .
13,6,6,Well  I understand how you feel  and we will try to do our best to help you . But first please allow me to send one of the housemaids to your room to look for it again thoroughly  just in case it's still in there . If she finds it  we will all be happy . If she doesn't  we will turn the whole matter to the police . But I must say that the hotel can't be held responsible for your loss . You should have locked your gold necklace away at the hotel ' s safety box . If you had read your key card carefully  you would have realized that we specially warned you to do so .
14,5,6,That just isn't good enough . Cet me your general manager . I want to speak to him now .
15,6,6,I am sorry  ma ' am . Our general manager is not in town . But I ' d be more than glad to get you our assistant manager  if you like . But I am afraid that he will say the same thing . We have very clear instructions about valuables and we must follow them . And now if you will excuse me  I'll go and find our assistant manager for you .

4,6,6,I had fried shrimp and clams for lunch .
5,6,6,Perhaps the food was bad .
6,1,6,Perhaps  but I haven ' t felt well for a few days now .
7,6,6,Has anything been upsetting you lately ?
8,1,6,My stress level is pretty much what is usually is .

5,2,6,It was hardly all night . And I recall it was you doing all the laughing at your own jokes .
6,1,6,That's not fair . We had fun . Give me a second chance . Can we meet tomorrow night for drinks at the pub ?

1,5,6,I just discovered that I owe $ 10 for a movie that I never ordered .
2,6,6,Let me check  sir . You were charged for watching ' Titanic ' Monday night .
3,5,6,That is absolutely incorrect ! I was out on the town Monday night .
4,6,6,Okay  sir  bear with me a moment .
5,6,6,Thank you for taking my word over the computer's word .
6,6,6,One slight problem  sir . I need to charge you $ 2 to remove this error from your file .
7,6,6,You can
8,6,6,I feel your pain  sir .

 (1, 1),(3, 3),(5, 5),
1,5,6,I swear I will never shop at a street market in China . It's a terrible place full of excellent profiteers ! You have to keep an eye whenever it comes to paying for something .
2,6,6,cool down  Harry ! What are you really mad about ? Did you get ripped off ?
3,5,6,yes . Last Sunday I went to a nearby market . It was on open-air fair . I chanced upon this bag and bought it on the spot  without even trying to strike a bargain . I paid one hundred and twenty . And just now I was told by my Chinese colleagues I bought it overpriced . I could have talked my way to thirty .
4,6,6,is that so ? I'm afraid people here will not take pity on unlucky guys like you . Bargaining has always been an indispensable procedure in business deals . It's the norm of free trade . The seller sets a preposterous price  and the buyer tries his best to bring it down  until a compromise is reached . Yet you ignored the process . No wonder you ended up easy prey .
5,5,6,but don't you think it annoying to overcharge the customers by such a handsome margin ?
6,6,6,of course  that's something really irritating . And the only way to avoid being trapped is to know in advance about the real worth of the stuff . I recommend you to consult the price tags in the supermarket first . And then you may negotiate for a fair deal .

5,6,6,But it's true .
6,5,6,How can believe it if the same excuse was used twice within a week ?
7,6,6,That's coincident .

2,6,6,Oh  I'm fine .
3,6,6,So  are you going to go to class tonight ?
4,1,6,Maybe ... but I don't think so .
5,3,6,Really ? What's the matter ?
6,1,6,I don't know . I'm just feeling a little sad .
7,0,6,Listen . Come with me to class  and after class we can go out for dinner .
8,0,6,Now that's a good idea . Thanks a lot  Brian . I'm feeling better already .

1,6,6,I like this apartment . Do you think we can afford the mortgage ?
2,0,6,Yes . I think so . It ' s not a very expensive apartment . It ' s in the right area and it has everything that we are looking for . The rooms are quite large too .
3,0,6,I love the balcony . We can sit outside and enjoy the sun in summer . We are on the 12th floor  so there ' s very nice view from the balcony .
4,0,6,The neighbourhood is nice too . There is a park nearby .
5,0,6,Yes  and there are many houses nearby . I like it that the neighbourhood isn ' t full of apartment blocks .
6,1,6,It ' s a pity we can ' t afford a house . A garden would be so nice .
7,6,6,Yes  it would . Don ' t worry . There ' s a lawn outside the building and there ' s the park nearby . This place will be fine .
8,0,6,The building is quite new and well constructed . I ' m happy with the fittings too .
9,0,6,Yes  everything has been well designed .

1,0,6,What a beautiful watch . It goes very well with your ring .
2,0,6,Thank you .
3,0,6,Is that your wedding ring ?
4,0,6,I'm not married yet . It's my engagement ring .
5,0,6,Well  congratulations . When is the big date ?
6,0,6,In June .
7,0,6,Did you have the watch before getting the ring ?
8,0,6,Actually  we bought the ring together after I got the watch .
9,0,6,You did a fabulous job with the selection . It's gorgeous .
10,0,6,Thank you so much .
11,6,6,What kind of watch is it ?
12,6,6,It's a Tag Heer .
13,6,6,If you don't mind me asking  how much do they cost ?
14,6,6,This one is $ 1500 . But they range from $ 600 to $ 3000 .
15,0,6,That's why it looks so nice . I should have figured . You always get what you pay for .
16,0,6,Yeah . I would rather get one nice watch instead of 20 mediocre ones .

1,6,6,Well  Yuri  tell me about it .
2,6,6,I'm sorry I can't bring better news  sir . The site is a disaster .
3,6,6,That's what I was afraid of .
4,6,6,It is not only the earthquake  sir . But the mudslides . Much of the north half of the site has been covered over by mud .
5,3,6,Mud ? But Ivan told me there were no mudslides in that district . I thought all the mudslides were down in Chichitango .
6,6,6,That's what we thought  sir . That's what the news reported . But there was one little mudslide in our district too . Right above our site .
7,1,6,Oh  that's terrible ! What bad luck ! I wish we had never come to this country . But  if it isn't the strikes and the revolutionaries  it's the earthquakes . Our operations here are finished !
8,1,6,I'm sorry  sir .
9,6,6,It's not your fault  Yuri . But tell me . When will Ivan be able to get out there ?
10,6,6,Well  it took me about nine hours to get back here by car . If Ivan leaves tonight  I think he should be there by tomorrow lunch .
11,6,6,Good . I want an estimate of damages as soon as possible .
12,6,6,But sir ...
13,6,6,Yes  Yuri ?
14,6,6,I wouldn't recommend sending Ivan now . Especially not at night . The roads aren't safe .
15,6,6,Has the earthquake damaged the bridges too ?
16,6,6,No  sir . The bridges are fine . But I've heard rumors that the revolutionaries are coming down from the mountains . There has been fighting  sir .
17,6,6,Are you serious ? Fighting ? But I didn't hear anything on the news .
18,6,6,You know the government controls the press here  sir . They don't want it reported .
19,1,6,Oh  this is terrible  Yuri . Terrible ! So we can't even assess the damages . How can we do business in this country ? Either we're buried under mud  or we're in danger of getting kidnapped . No  I can't believe this mess !
20,1,6,I'm sorry  sir .
21,1,6,You don't have to keep saying that  Yuri . It's not your fault . But me--I'm the one who should be sorry . It was me who suggested operations here in the first place ! Oh  what can we do ?

1,6,6,Alright  tell me what you think about this one .
2,6,6,Don't you think it's a bit bright ?
3,6,6,Yeah  maybe you're right . How about this outfit ?
4,6,6,That dress looks lovely on you  but it's not very practical  is it ?
5,0,6,No  I don't have any plans to go to a formal dance any time soon  but I love the way it looks . I just want to try it on ! What do you think about this ? It's casual  yet sophisticated .
6,6,6,I like the jeans  but you need something to go with the top . It's too plain on its own .
7,6,6,How about this scarf  these earrings  and an anklet ?
8,6,6,That might be going overboard a bit . How about just that scarf with a bracelet ?
9,0,6,That's a good idea . You have a lot of good fashion sense .
10,0,6,Thanks . You'd be OK on your own . There are loads of fashion victims out there  and you are not one of them . Have you tried it on yet ?
11,6,6,Yep . Here it is . What do you think ?
12,0,6,That looks great . Just one more thing-you need some high heels with those jeans . Do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ?
13,0,6,The leopard print sounds fabulous . OK  I'll take it .

2,0,6,I'd love to ! But I have never learned martial arts  and there is only a month left before the New Year .
3,6,6,That's OK . A month is enough for you to learn the basic movements . It would be great to have you with us on the show .
4,0,6,Sounds great ! Shall I learn the actions that Jet Li did in the movies ?
5,6,6,No . You know  there are many schools and styles of kung fu . What we will perform is a set of Chinese shadow boxing .
6,0,6,Whatever ! I'm glad to learn something of Chinese kung fu . Thanks for asking me .

3,4,6,I think someone is stalking me .
4,3,6,No  it can't be . Really ? Who ?
5,4,6,I don't know . I saw him the first time Tuesday . He was at the cafe . I noticed he was looking at me a lot . Not just the usual looking  but staring . He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop .
6,6,6,What did you do ?
7,4,6,I didn't do anything . Finally  he left . But then I saw him again today . Outside the shoe store . Near the cafe . I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's . But then he came in too .
8,6,6,Did he leave when you left ?
9,4,6,Yes . Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . He was following me .

5,0,6,I had a great time too and was thinking that maybe you might want to join me for a hike to the waterfalls on Saturday .
6,0,6,A hike would be great ! Let me pack us a nice picnic lunch  OK ?
7,0,6,Linda  that would be a perfect addition .
8,0,6,I'll take care of the lunch then  and you can take care of the other plans . What time would you like to pick me up ?
9,6,6,I was hoping to leave by 9 o'clock so that it won \ ' t be too hot for the hike .

4,0,6,Dessert sounds perfect  but I would like to split something with my friends .
5,6,6,On this evening's dessert list  we have chocolate mousse cake  homemade fresh strawberry shortcake  and a spicy rum apple crisp .
6,0,6,I think that the apple crisp would be wonderful .
7,6,6,One dessert will serve two  so would you like to split a second one ?
8,6,6,We would also like a piece of chocolate mousse cake . Could you bring us four dessert forks  please ?
9,6,6,How about some coffee and tea as well ?
10,6,6,We are all tea drinkers . Please bring us four teas .

5,6,6,Did you stop at the big waterfall for pictures ?
6,0,6,Sure  we wouldn't miss it for anything . After that  we took a short cut to the park . There was very little traffic  so we got there in less than an hour .
7,0,6,You were lucky then . What did you do after that ?
8,0,6,We went for a swim in the sea . That was the best part of the day . Just look at my nice tan .
9,0,6,So you must have had a busy and enjoyable day yesterday .

3,5,6,You can't be serious !
4,5,6,Hey  I've always gone hunting or fishing on vacation . I am sorry that bothers you .
5,5,6,After a year together  I thought it pretty safe to assume that we would automatically spend our vacation together .
6,5,6,Says who ? I don't think that is necessarily the case .

2,6,6,Dan is on top of that . I think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
3,5,6,That would be convenient . They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . The circuit breakers keep going out all the time . It ' s really annoying !
4,5,6,Yeah you are right . This office is falling apart ! Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that ' s why the parking lot was flooded .
5,5,6,I know ! I was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! The handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .

4,0,6,You should . Many Guiliners  especially the old and the young  will climb mountains here in the morning .
5,0,6,No wonder people say
6,3,6,Quick ! Pass me your binoculars . Look at that bird ... I've never seen one of those before . It's indigenous to Guiling  and an endangered species too . This is lucky !
7,0,6,I didn't know you liked bird-watching .

2,0,6,Thank you  Rick ! As you can see  ladies and gentleman  we are here in beautiful Pebble Beach where the top golfers in the world are trying to win the grand prize of one million dollars !
3,0,6,Whoa  that ' s a lot of cash ! Let ' s go to the course and see how Tiger Woods is doing .
4,0,6,All right  we are here at the eighth hole . It ' s a par four  and has some very difficult hazards which many golfers find difficult to avoid . Although  I did see Jack Nicklaus hit a hole in one on this very same hole !
5,0,6,Tiger Woods is about to tee off  and let ' s see if he has the same luck as Jack . Tiger is asking his caddie for his driver and  he seems to be very nervous .
6,1,6,Oh no ! Not a good swing at all ! It ' s definitely not his day today . On the seventh hole he got a bogey and before that he barely made par . He will definitely not get a birdie on this shot .
7,1,6,It seems that his ball has flown somewhere deep in the trees . He is having a hard time finding it and even his caddie has climbed a tree to try and spot it .
8,4,6,Oh no ! A bear ! Run  Tiger  run ! Somebody call animal control !

8,6,6,You can have a free facial and then make up free for you . Do you want it now ?
9,1,6,Probably not . Doing that will probably take another three hours which I can't afford now .
10,6,6,Here is our number . Call us when you are ready to come .

1,6,6,Hi  Mary  I have decided to look for a job as a salesman .
2,6,6,Good ! Have you got the recruitment information on marketing ?
3,6,6,Yes . I have found some through different channels .
4,3,6,Really ? That's great ! Tell me .
5,6,6,OK . The first piece of job information I got was from the Internet  and it is about selling medicines .
6,6,6,What do you think of this job ?
7,6,6,I am not familiar with the medicine industry  and I don't think it fits me well .
8,6,6,Then how about the others ?
9,6,6,Another is about electronic commerce  and its products are mainly large machinery equipments .
10,6,6,I have heard about electronic commerce  and many people say it has good prospects for development .
11,6,6,I also feel it's nice . I want to give it a try .
12,0,6,Come on ! I believe you will succeed .
13,0,6,Thanks . You can also seek job information on the Internet .
14,0,6,Good idea . I will think it over .

1,5,6,I can't stand the stupid guy any longer . It's unbelievable .
2,6,6,Oh  my dear lady  take it easy . You should forgive a green hand like him .
3,5,6,He does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy .
4,6,6,I suggest you talk with him and teach him how to deal with the problems .
5,5,6,I've told him how to do that several times  but he's never listened to me .
6,6,6,Maybe you should communicate with him just like a friend  not a boss .
7,1,6,Oh  I always have difficulty in getting along with the staff .
8,6,6,Just take them for your good friends and have a talk with them as we do . Make sure you won't lose your temper !
9,6,6,Oh  so bad . I'm afraid I'll change the image of myself .
10,6,6,No  it's unnecessary . Just respect the staff and their own opinions .
11,6,6,But sometimes they offer some useless proposals  it's awfully useless .
12,6,6,Oh  no one is perfect .
13,6,6,That's right . I should speak to them in a polite way .
14,6,6,We have the equal partnership in team .
15,0,6,Thanks very much and you're very eloquent .
16,0,6,Thanks for saying that .

1,4,6,That was really a nightmare !
2,6,6,Honey  what's up ?
3,4,6,I was stuck between 15th and 16th floors in the elevator .
4,3,6,Oh  really ? I know that telephone signal must have been shielded in the elevator shaft  so what did you do then ?
5,4,6,I pressed the emergency button ! And then I stayed in the elevator waiting for the rescue .
6,6,6,Did you panic at the time ?
7,6,6,A little bit  but I know that the elevator isn't enclosed . at least I wouldn't be smothered there .
8,6,6,Was there anyone else with you ?
9,6,6,Of course  there are 6 other people in the elevator ; they were so scared that someone even started crying .
10,6,6,So you mean that you were the only brave one there ?
11,6,6,Yes . I have to call the property management .
12,6,6,For what ? Complaining about what happened in the elevator ?
13,6,6,Yes . They should check the elevator regularly . I have to give them something to remember about  and they should also equip fire extinguishers in the building .
14,6,6,That was just an accident . you are worried too much about it . I think the property management will check the elevator and improve their service from now on .
15,6,6,I know what you mean  but I'd better remind them again  and also remind them to repair the button in the elevator for the disabled people . That has brought the disabled people lots of inconvenience .

1,0,6,Great . The bed is exactly what I have been looking for !
2,6,6,You have good taste . It's made of red wood .
3,6,6,Oh  I like red wood . How much do you charge for it ?
4,6,6,300 dollars .
5,5,6,That's sheer robbery !
6,6,6,Believe me  it's worth the price .
7,6,6,It's more than I can afford . Can I make an offer ?
8,6,6,How much are you willing to pay ?
9,6,6,Shall we make it 250 dollars ?
10,1,6,No . That price would hardly cover the cost .
11,6,6,What about 260 dollars ?
12,6,6,275 dollars is the lowest price I can offer .
13,0,6,It's a deal .

1,6,6,You ' re home late today  David . How was school ?
2,6,6,Not bad . There ' s a new English teacher .
3,6,6,Oh  what ' s she like ?
4,0,6,She is beautiful .
5,6,6,Is she old or young ?
6,0,6,She is quite young and her hair is blond .
7,6,6,Is she strict ?
8,0,6,Not really . Her eyes are blue .
9,6,6,Can she speak Chinese ?
10,0,6,Not much . She is very tall and slim .
11,6,6,David  stop dreaming . It ' s time to do your homework .

1,6,6,Have you got your invitation yet ?
2,3,6,My invitation ? No  I haven't . My invitation to what ?
3,6,6,The house warming party .
4,6,6,Whose house warming party is it ?
5,6,6,Tom and Bill Smith . They are both working now you know ? And they've bought a new house .
6,3,6,Oh  they have ? I didn't know . I haven't seen Tom lately .
7,6,6,It's out in the suburbs .
8,6,6,Have you seen the house ?
9,6,6,Yes  I have . I went out with them last weekend .
10,6,6,Is it nice ?
11,6,6,Yes  it is . There are three bedrooms  a living room  a dining room  and a big kitchen . There's also a garden .
12,0,6,Well  that does sound nice . Have they moved in yet ?
13,6,6,They are moving today . Tom's taken the day off . He's rented a truck  and they should have all their furniture in the house tonight .
14,6,6,When are they going to have the party ?
15,6,6,Next Saturday night . You should get your invitation today or tomorrow .
16,0,6,Wow  that would be something to look forward to .

 (9, 6),(9, 7),(9, 8),(10, 9),(12, 11),(12, 12),(17, 16),(17, 17),
1,6,6,alright  tell me what you think .
2,6,6,don't you think it ' s a bit bright ?
3,6,6,yeah  maybe you ' re right . How about this outfit ?
4,6,6,that dress looks lovely on you  but it ' s not very practical  is it ?
5,6,6,no  I don't have an plans to go to a formal dance any time soon  but I love the way it looks . I just had to try it on ! What do you think about this ? It ' s casual  yet sophisticated .
6,6,6,I like the jeans  but you need something to go with the top . It ' s too plain on its own .
7,6,6,how about this scarf  these earrings  and an anklet ?
8,6,6,that might be going overboard a bit . How about just that scarf with a bracelet ?
9,0,6,that ' s a good idea . You have a lot of good fashion sense .
10,0,6,thanks . You ' d be ok on your own . There are loads of fashion victims out there  and you are not one of them . Have you tried it on yet ?
11,6,6,yep . Here it is . What do you think ?
12,0,6,that looks great . Just one more thing---you need some high heels with those jeans . Do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ?
13,6,6,the leopard print sounds fabulous . Are they a name brand ?
14,6,6,no  they ' re a Prada knock-off for 1/10 of the price of the real thing .
15,6,6,that ' s even better than the real thing .
16,6,6,if I were you  I ' d buy that now while it ' s on sale . If you spend more than $ 100  you get a $ 50 voucher for more clothes .
17,1,6,it ' s too bad I did all that shopping yesterday !

 (1, 1),(2, 1),(3, 3),(4, 3),(4, 4),(5, 4),(6, 5),(13, 12),
1,0,6,Hey  Blake ! Are you still listening to Mozart ?
2,0,6,Yes . Do you like it ?
3,0,6,It's great . and I ' Ve heard that listening to Mozart can make you more intelligent .
4,3,6,Really ? I've never heard that before . I just like it .
5,0,6,Is classical music your favorite ?
6,0,6,Yes . What about you ?
7,6,6,I Like pop music best . Classical music is a bit too heavy for me . I can't get fully relaxed in it .
8,6,6,Pop music doesn't have any depth for me .
9,6,6,Yeah  that's why I can enjoy myself in it .
10,6,6,Did you always like pop music .
11,6,6,I think so  since I was in primary school . How long have you been interested in classical music .
12,6,6,I didn't like it at all until I started to learn violin when I was eight . From then on . classical music has been an important part of my life .
13,3,6,oh  I didn't know you can play the violin . Do you still play .
14,6,6,Sometimes  but these days I'm often too busy .

1,6,6,Hello  ma ' am  can I help you find something ?
2,6,6,Yes  actually I ' m looking to buy a camera .
3,6,6,We ' Ve got a wide selection do you know if you ' d like a point-and-shoot  or something a little fancier ? Are you shopping for yourself or for someone else ?
4,6,6,Actually I ' m buying a camera for my husband .
5,6,6,Ah  well then I ' d recommend a nice entry-level digital SLR .
6,6,6,Yeah ? Can I take a look at the Sirs you carry ?
7,0,6,Sure thing  follow me . This here is the .
8,6,6,The Canon Eos . Yeah it ' s ok  but I ' m looking for something that performs better in low light  has a better display panel  and longer battery life .
9,6,6,Oh  ah  um the Nikon D60 is a nice option .
10,6,6,Yeah  but what kit lens does this camera come with ? I don ' t want some bulky telephoto lens .
11,6,6,Oh  well this one has the  uh .
12,6,6,Looks to me like an 18-55 mm lens . pretty standard  that will do . Not like my husband will be stalking celebrities or anything !
13,6,6,So  ahem  can I interest you in any acc ...
14,6,6,Accessories ? Do you carry polarizing filters ?
15,1,6,Polarizing filter um we should ! I ' m sorry  ma ' am . It looks like we ' re sold out .
16,0,6,No you ' re not ! There are some right here !
17,0,6,Oh  well  would you look at that ! Polarizing filters .
18,0,6,Thanks for your help  Ralph !

1,0,6,Hi ! I see you are having fun with your new computer and internet connection .
2,6,6,There ' s so much I want to do . I ' Ve just finished sending lots of emails to friends and family all over the world . I just ran a search for music to download .
3,6,6,I can give you the name of a few useful website to visit .
4,0,6,Thanks . That would be very helpful . I ' Ve discovered that it can take a long time to find exactly what you want . There ' s too much information on the net .
5,6,6,When you sent your emails  did you attach any files to them ?
6,6,6,Yes  I did . There ' s an anti-virus programme with my email account that scans all attachments  so I ' m sure I haven ' t sent anything nasty to anyone .
7,6,6,When you use the internet  be careful not to give out your email address very often . If you do  you might get a lot of spam-unwanted email form companies trying to sell you things .
8,0,6,That ' s good advice . I should also be careful about giving out confidential information about myself  such as my password and credit car number .
9,6,6,That ' s right . Another thing to remember when you are surfing is that you can add a web page to your list of favourites . Your computer will remember the page and you can return there quickly next time
10,6,6,How do I do that ?
11,6,6,Take this web page for example . Press the keys control and d together . Click on favourites at the top of the screen . There you are . It has been added to you favourites list . If you click it  you will
12,0,6,That ' s useful to know . Thanks . I ' ll just log off and shout down my computer and we can go for a coffee .

 (4, 3),(4, 4),(13, 13),(15, 14),(23, 22),
1,5,6,Ah ! No ! Damn it !
2,6,6,It's a blackout . Now I can't see Seinfeld .
3,6,6,So what ? I just lost one hour's worth of work .
4,3,6,Really ? How could you do that ? Don't you save every couple minutes ?
5,6,6,No  I didn't save this time . Damn it ! And I'm sick of writing this paper . Now I have to write it all over again too .
6,6,6,I've had that problem too many times . So I learned to save . When I'm writing something  I save every three sentences or so . I don't want to lose anything .
7,6,6,I hate computers . Sometimes I think they cause more trouble than they're worth .
8,6,6,What are we going to do now ?
9,6,6,I don't know . I feel like going out .
10,6,6,I wonder how much of the city is down .
11,6,6,It doesn't matter . I still can go out and buy a beer .
12,6,6,Maybe . But if there's a blackout  probably the pubs are closed . And besides  I know you have a political science exam tomorrow . I thought you had a lot of reading to do .
13,5,6,Yes  that's true . Damn ! I just lost half my paper  and now I can't even do my homework . This is a bad time for this to happen .
14,6,6,I have a flashlight in my closet . If you want to use that to read  you can .
15,0,6,Thanks . I think I will try . Where are you going ?
16,6,6,I like your idea of getting a beer . I think I'll go out myself .
17,6,6,Maybe we can trade . Why don't you stay here and read for my exam  and I'll go drink beer ?
18,6,6,No  it just won't work . If I read for your exam  you won't know the answers tomorrow . I will .
19,6,6,So ? You can go to the class for me . Just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . Why not ?
20,6,6,How many students are in the class ?
21,6,6,About fourteen .
22,6,6,So it won't work  old buddy . They'll see that I'm not you . Sorry .
23,5,6,Damn !

1,6,6,Next please ! Hello sir  may I see your passport please ?
2,6,6,Yes  here you go .
3,6,6,Will you be checking any bags today .
4,6,6,Yes  I ' d like to check three pieces .
5,6,6,I ' m sorry  sir . Airline policy allows only two pieces of checked luggage  at twenty kilograms each  plus one piece of carry-on luggage . I will have to charge you extra for the additional suitcase .
6,5,6,What ? Why ! I am taking an intercontinental flight ! I ' m flying sixteen thousand CMS ! How am I supposed to only take two  twenty kilo bags ? That ' absurd !
7,6,6,I am sorry  sir  there ' s nothing I can do . You cannot board the flight with that large bag either . Carry - on bags must fit in the over-head compartment or under your seat . That bag is clearly too big .
8,5,6,Now I see . You charge next to nothing for an international ticket  but when it comes to charging for any other small thing  you charge an arm and a leg ! So tell me  miss  how much will I have to pay for all of this .
9,6,6,Let ' s see ... six hundred and twenty-five US dollars .
10,5,6,That ' s more than my round-trip ticket !

1,0,6,Morning  Peter . Nice suit ! A new one ?
2,0,6,Oh  yes . My wife bought it for me yesterday . Hmm  you look nice in that yellow dress . Yellow suits you really well .
3,6,6,Maybe . Several people have suggested that I get more yellow clothes . They say the color suits me because I have a fair complexion .
4,0,6,That's right . You know  pink  green and black could also be good for you . Actually  I think that all colors are okay for a person with your complexion . It's just that different colors can give people different impressions . For example  black could make you look mature  while pink could make you look young and energetic .
5,0,6,Thank you for your compliments . It sounds like you're a clothing expert .
6,0,6,Well  compared with my wife  I'm just a beginner .

2,2,6,I don't know . I just know I've never been asked so many questions in my life .
3,6,6,How many of them were there ?
4,2,6,Three-but there was one of them who kept asking really stupid questions .
5,6,6,Like what ?
6,2,6,Oh  he wanted to know what time I got up this morning and if I bad a bath or a shower you know  things like that .
7,6,6,What on earth has that got to do with some money disappearing ?
8,2,6,I've no idea . Oh yes  and the most ridiculous thing . He asked me what I had for breakfast this morning .
9,6,6,Oh well  that's it . They obviously think you're a desperate criminal and you have to steal to eat . I should think you'll get thirty years .
10,6,6,Hmm . Thank you very much .

1,0,6,Did you watch the final last night ? My favorite singer won !
2,0,6,Oh  I love him too . He not only sings well but also shows perseverance when he encounters difficulties in the contest .
3,0,6,Yeah  he got booted after his initial performance in the audition  but he did not give up . He then tried at another two auditions .
4,0,6,He had barely survived the third audition and finally got a chance to advance in the contest . Fortunately  in the third audition  he has won popularity among the audience . And that's when I started to notice him .
5,0,6,Me too .
6,0,6,Before he made the top three  I was so nervous . I just fear that he might be knocked out .
7,0,6,Yeah  there're so many excellent candidates out there . Who knows which one will make it to the final ?
8,0,6,Absolutely . That's why when he entered the final  I was so excited .
9,0,6,He really did a great job in the finale  especially in the PK round . He performed so well that the majority of the audience cast their votes for him .
10,0,6,And the host announced that he won it all !

2,6,6,Here you are .
3,6,6,Excuse me  sir . This is your passport .
4,3,6,Really ? Ugh ... Is there any difference ?
5,6,6,Yes . As a matter of fact  you can't board the plane without boarding pass .
6,1,6,Gee . I must have left it in my hotel room .
7,6,6,I'm sorry sir . I can't let you pass .
8,6,6,But when does the plane take off ?
9,6,6,Ugh  in about thirty minutes  sir .
10,1,6,Oh  my God ! What do I do now ? Bone head  bone head  bone head ( He smashes his head with his hand . ) .
11,6,6,Calm down  sir . You are creating a commotion .
12,6,6,( The speaker in the airport says  ' Mr . Benjamin  we now have a boarding pass by the name of Benjamin at Lost and Found . ' ) Is that me ?
13,6,6,Could be .
14,0,6,Oh  thank God . Thank you  I'll be right back .
15,6,6,( Benjamin starts to run and then he seems to remember something and returns . ) Ugh  excuse me  where is the Lost and Found ?
16,6,6,It's down in the lobby . Turn left at exit B .

1,6,6,Good morning . I ' m from the New York book review . Could I ask you some questions about your latest book ?
2,6,6,Sure . Take a seat ... what would you like to know ?
3,6,6,First  I ' Ve heard that your latest book is based on a true story .
4,0,6,That ' s correct . It ' s a murder mystery based on actual murders that book place in Florida several years ago . The main character-the police invesigator-is based on the man who investigated the case .
5,0,6,How do you research your books ?
6,0,6,I always visit the places that I use as setting for stories . Readers like things to be as factually correct as possible-even in fiction ! I usually base my characters on people I have met . Most character are a mixture of the characters of two or more people .
7,0,6,I really like your books . I ' Ve just finished this one . I read it from cover to cover in a single day . Congratulation on making the bestseller list yet again !
8,0,6,Thank you . Let met sign it for you ... there you go .
9,0,6,Oh ! Thank you very much . I heard that you are currently writing a collection of short stories . What are the stories about ?
10,0,6,There ' s a real mix of stories in the book . I haven ' t finished all of them yet  though . Many of them are short detective stories  but there are also horror stories and sci-fi ones . If you give me your business card  I ' ll make sure you get an advance copy to review .
11,0,6,Thanks very much . I ' m sure it will sell well . I can ' t wait to read it . Here ' s my card . Thank you for you time .

2,5,6,No  the steak was recommended  but it is not very fresh .
3,1,6,Oh ! Sorry to hear that . This is quite unusual as we have steak from the market every day .
4,5,6,So what ? It is not fresh and I'm not happy about it .
5,1,6,I'm sorry  sir . Do you wish to try something else ? That would be on the house  of course .
6,5,6,No  thank you .

3,6,6,It ' s certainly a pretty dress . I can ring you up at the register over here .
4,0,6,Great .
5,6,6,Will you be paying by cash  check  or credit card ?
6,6,6,I want to use a credit card . Do you take Discover ?
7,1,6,Sorry  no . We only take MasterCard or Visa .
8,6,6,I ' ll put it on my Visa card  then .
9,6,6,Very well  ma ' am . Oh  there seems to be a problem  it says it ' s rejected .
10,6,6,There must be something wrong with the system . Try my MasterCard .
11,0,6,Alright . Thank you . Yes  it seems to be working fine . Your total is $ 199 . 00  sign here  please .

3,6,6,They did ?
4,5,6,They had no reason for arresting me .
5,6,6,I thought they let you go .
6,6,6,Yes  the next morning .
7,6,6,They made you spend the night at the station ?
8,6,6,Yes  they did .
9,6,6,What was their reason for arresting you ?
10,6,6,I matched the description of a bank robber they were looking for .

9,6,6,I will  but let's go to the disco after dinner .

5,0,6,Would you like another beer ?
6,6,6,I'll have another cup of beer insist . I know I don't like to drink alone  especially there are someone sitting there next to me .

2,0,6,Thank you for meeting me here .
3,6,6,It's no problem .
4,6,6,I need to speak with you about your daughter .
5,6,6,Is there something wrong ?
6,0,6,I enjoy having your daughter in my class .
7,0,6,I'm glad to hear it .
8,0,6,She is a great addition to my class .
9,6,6,You don't have anything bad to say about her ?
10,0,6,She is always behaving herself  and she's so smart .
11,0,6,I am so happy that she's doing okay .
12,0,6,I'm more than happy having her in my class .

1,0,6,Everything is now . I'm kind of sick of it .
2,6,6,Each ring has 3 small diamonds inside the band .
3,0,6,Oooh ! One for each of the zeros in 2000 ! Wow !
4,6,6,Stop making fun of me .
5,0,6,So find a guy to marry and you can get one !
6,6,6,I don't need a guy to buy a wedding ring !
7,0,6,Oh  I see . You're going to wear one and pretend you're married to try to attract guys .

1,6,6,When will I get a raise ?
2,6,6,In three months or so ?
3,5,6,You said the same thing three months ago .
4,6,6,Did I ? Well . Anyway  you'll get your raise when the economy starts picking up .
5,5,6,You mean I won't get a raise until recession ends ?
6,6,6,Yes .
7,5,6,I got the message . I am quitting .

 (6, 6),(7, 6),(8, 8),(9, 8),(9, 9),
1,6,6,Hello  BCD Company  can I help you ?
2,6,6,Hello  may I speak to Mrs Smith ?
3,6,6,This is Mrs Smith  may I have your name ?
4,6,6,This is Sun  and I interviewed with you yesterday .
5,6,6,Hello  Mr . Sun .
6,0,6,I am calling to thank you for giving me the interview for the Sales Manager position yesterday .
7,0,6,You are welcome  Mr . Sun .
8,0,6,I really enjoyed meeting with you .
9,0,6,You certainly made a good impression on me  as well .
10,6,6,I am very interested in this position .
11,6,6,We'll be making the decision by the end of this week and we'll contact you as soon as possible .
12,6,6,Well  thank you for your time and consideration again .
13,6,6,You are welcome .

 (2, 2),(3, 2),(3, 3),(8, 7),
1,6,6,So can you fix it ?
2,1,6,I ' m sorry sir . This computer is not broken or damaged . It ' s simply just too old ! That ' s why your programs and applications are running slow . There really isn ' t much I can do .
3,3,6,What do you mean ? I bought this computer just three years ago !
4,6,6,Yes  but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster !
5,6,6,OK  I know where this is going . How much will it cost me to get a new computer ?
6,6,6,Well  this desktop over here is our latest model . It has a four gigahertz processor with sixteen gigabytes in RAM and a hard disk with one terabyte . Of course  it includes a mouse  keyboard and desk speakers .
7,6,6,I have no idea what you are talking about . I just want to know if it ' s good and if I will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time !
8,5,6,This PC is top of the line and I guarantee it will never freeze ! If it does  we ' ll give you your money back !
8728 14
 (1, 1),(2, 2),(5, 4),(14, 13),
1,0,6,it ' s so great to be here ! I ' m so excited to help you and my daughter with your new home !
2,0,6,we ' re glad that you ' re here . Would you like a tour of the house ?
3,6,6,that ' d be great  but could I have a cup of tea first ?
4,6,6,sure  I ' ll just go put the kettle on . Why don ' t you have a seat on the sofa and I ' ll go take care of things in the kitchen .
5,0,6,that would be lovely  thanks .
6,6,6,do you take milk or sugar with your tea ?
7,6,6,I ' ll take a little milk  but no sugar  please . Make sure you let the tea steep a few minutes before you take the tea bag out of the cup .
8,6,6,ok . What do you think about our living room ?
9,6,6,well  I do like the mantelpiece and the coffee table  but I don ' t really care for curtains . Did you get them at a yard sale ? They look ancient .
10,6,6,my parents gave them to us as a house warming gift .
11,6,6,oh dear . Well  I suppose they will do for now . do you ever dust in here ? It seems a bit dusty in here .
12,6,6,your daughter usually does the dusting  and I do the vacuuming .
13,6,6,I see . Well  I can help with the chores while I ' m here . You two could probably use my help .
14,0,6,that ' s very nice of you to offer . Here ' s your tea . Be careful  it ' s still quite hot .

 (1, 1),(2, 1),(3, 1),(3, 3),(4, 3),(4, 4),
1,0,6,Your knowledge of English is really surprising .
2,0,6,Oh  it's nothing to speak of .
3,0,6,No  seriously . I am impressed .
4,0,6,Thank you . I appreciate the compliment .

1,6,6,Are you going to vote this Tuesday ?
2,0,6,Yes  I am  and I am so excited .
3,6,6,Have you figured out who you ' re going to vote for ?
4,0,6,I love my candidate .
5,6,6,Why is that ?
6,0,6,My candidate is probably the most intelligent .
7,6,6,Is that right ?
8,0,6,I also agree with all his policies .
9,0,6,That ' s great !
10,0,6,I know he ' s going to be the next President .
11,0,6,Hopefully  he will be .
12,0,6,I can ' t wait to vote .

 (6, 6),(7, 6),(7, 7),(12, 10),(12, 11),(12, 12),
1,6,6,Do you have any shoes like these ?
2,6,6,What size ?
3,6,6,Size five .
4,6,6,What colour ?
5,6,6,Black .
6,1,6,I ' m sorry . We don't haven any .
7,3,6,But my sister bought this pair last month .
8,6,6,Did she buy them here ?
9,6,6,No  she bought them in the U . S .
10,6,6,We had some shoes like those a month ago  but we don't have any now .
11,6,6,Can you get a pair for me please ?
12,1,6,I ' m afraid that I can ' t . They were in fashion last year and the year before last . But they ' re not in fashion this year . These shoes are in fashion now .
13,6,6,They look very uncomfortable .
14,6,6,They are very uncomfortable . But women always wear uncomfortable shoes !

 (2, 1),(9, 1),(9, 9),(9, 9),(10, 10),(10, 10),
1,6,6,Our company is going to do some cutbacks soon .
2,3,6,Really ? Where did you hear that ?
3,6,6,I met with the supervisor just this morning . I don't know  but I am a little worried . Who do you think will get sacked ?
4,6,6,I'm not sure ... well  first  it couldn't be George . He is such a kiss-ass . He'd wash the boss's dog if he asked .
5,6,6,No  it's not going to be George . I don't think it's Andy either . He is involved with the boss's sister in-law . And you know how whipped our boss is .
6,6,6,That's true . What about Lisa ? I bet there's nobody who could do a worse job than her .
7,6,6,Lisa ? No way . I've heard a rumor that she and the boss were having an affair . You know rumors can't come out from nowhere .
8,6,6,Well  okay . Then there is still Michael . But he's the boss ' pet after having the best sales record for three months in a row . It definitely won't be Michael .
9,1,6,No  that would be crazy . But then who will it be ? Oh dear  it must be me . I should have known it ! Why else would he have talked to me alone about the downsizing . What should I do ? I've got a family to support .
10,1,6,Well  it could be me too . But I am not too worried . This place is suffocating me with this boss being such a hard-ass and colleagues who barely know how to get dressed in the morning . It would almost be a blessing to be fired from this place .
8640 16
 (2, 2),(4, 2),(4, 4),(9, 9),(11, 10),
1,6,6,Wow ! They've got everything here . All the world's famous brands . Aunt Cindy  what is your favorite brand ?
2,0,6,I love all the fashionable things . But my favorite brand is Chanel .
3,6,6,Oh  that's a very expensive brand  but with good reason .
4,0,6,Yeah . Each style is specially designed by world's top designers . So they can always make you look amazing .
5,6,6,I see . Come here . The high heels here look really attractive . But I wonder whether it's comfortable to wear any of them ?
6,6,6,Not really  especially at the beginning  if you wear high heels all day long  your feet would hurt . But  no big deal . Women can always get used to that .
7,6,6,It's not a simple thing to be beautiful .
8,6,6,Sure . But everyone loves to be beautiful . Hey  do you think this pair of sunglasses matches the handbag well ?
9,3,6,Yeah  very tasteful . And with them  you look even more fashionable . Oh  there are so many French perfumers . Oops  perfumes for guys ? So strange !
10,6,6,Come on . Fashion is not only for women . Men also share the equal right to chase fashion . It's the new fashion for men to wear perfumes  which is called cologne .
11,3,6,Oh  really  that's really something new . I'm afraid not everyone can accept it .
12,6,6,It takes time for that . But people's consuming attitudes are changing quickly .
13,6,6,That's true . Well  it's obvious that fashion is not a cheap thing . So  do you spend all your money on it ?
14,6,6,No . Fashion is just part of my life  which improves its quality . But also  I'm good at financing . I have a credit card  but I never overdraft .
15,6,6,How is it that you are my mom's sis ? You two are so different . She always picks up bargains and spends more than she earns . You do so much better than her .
16,6,6,I have to say that's just the result of difference of our consumptive habits .

 (1, 1),(2, 1),(3, 1),(3, 3),(4, 3),(4, 4),(5, 4),
1,0,6,Happy birthday  Jim !
2,0,6,Thank you  Lisa .
3,0,6,Here is a present for you . I hope you like it .
4,3,6,Oh  great ! I love it ! You know I've been expecting this for a long time .
5,0,6,I'm very glad to hear that .
6,6,6,Come here  let me introduce some friends to you .
847 13
 (3, 2),(5, 4),(7, 6),(8, 6),(9, 6),(9, 9),(10, 6),
1,6,6,What happened ? Why didn't he win ?
2,6,6,Didn't you hear ? He was disqualified .
3,3,6,How did that happen ? He's so talented ! I thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal !
4,6,6,If he didn't have any drug problems  he would have won .
5,3,6,What ? What kind of drugs was he using ?
6,6,6,He was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster .
7,2,6,I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs .
8,2,6,They are . The only reason they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards .
9,2,6,That's so disappointing . I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs .
10,2,6,I don't think it's right  but I can understand why they might . Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country !
11,6,6,Regardless of how much pressure you're under  there's never a good reason to take drugs .
12,6,6,I agree . Hopefully with the new regulations  fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs .
13,6,6,Let's hope so .
9643 16
 (1, 1),(7, 7),(8, 7),(9, 8),(9, 9),(10, 9),(10, 10),(16, 15),(16, 16),
1,3,6,Sis  why did you ask me to come to this bargain market ? It's so crowded  and you can't find anything that you really want .
2,6,6,You just don't get it . Looking for bargains can be really interesting .
3,6,6,Are you serious ? How can that be ?
4,6,6,Bargaining is a game  or even a battle . You feel like a winner when you get a good price .
5,6,6,Come on . You know  you can never really win . The salesperson never loses . They make their living out of it .
6,6,6,That's true . But I just love it . Come here !
7,0,6,Oh  this silk carpet is really beautiful . Look at the pattern  and how delicate it is !
8,0,6,You do have great taste . That's the most expensive stuff here .
9,0,6,Really ? Oh  this one . I like the cloisonn vase .
10,0,6,Are you kidding me ? I bought a same one last week . It's surprising that there is something we both like . Well  what do you think of these ceramic cups ?
11,6,6,Come on . They look so cheap . Something else  please .
12,6,6,What about this picture ? I think Benjamin would like it .
13,6,6,Don't underestimate his taste . I don't think he'd like it .
14,6,6,Don't be so sure . He loves the vase I bought here last week .
15,6,6,Yeah . Well  anyway  it's up to you . But I can tell that you come here often .
16,0,6,Absolutely . That's why I can always get a good price .
10488 10
 (3, 3),(4, 3),(4, 4),(8, 7),(8, 8),(8, 8),
1,6,6,Hey George  how is your chicken ?
2,6,6,My chicken tastes all right  but it is pretty dry . How is your fish ?
3,1,6,My fish is pretty dry too .
4,1,6,It's almost as if this food has been sitting a little too long . It doesn't seem fresh .
5,6,6,Yes  it seems that way to me also .
6,6,6,How are your vegetables ?
7,6,6,My vegetables are very soggy .
8,1,6,Mine are the same way . It seems like they've been overcooked .
9,6,6,I don't usually complain  but I think that we should mention this to the waiter .
10,6,6,I agree . Maybe they can bring us some better food .
10373 14
 (5, 5),(8, 8),(11, 11),(13, 11),
1,6,6,How do you want your hair cut ?
2,6,6,I want it the way Peckham wears it .
3,6,6,Who is Peckham ?
4,6,6,Are you kidding me ? Even the girls know Peckham . Whatever  I have a picture of him here .
5,0,6,You are a big fan of him ! He has strong legs .
6,6,6,Sure  he is a soccer star .
7,6,6,Hey  wake up . It's done . How do you like it ?
8,5,6,Oh  my God . It's disaster . It makes my head look like a soccer ball .
9,6,6,But it's the same hairstyle .
10,6,6,It looks like the hairstyle of Kahn who stands beside him in the picture .
11,1,6,Oh . I made a mistake . I thought the guy on the right was Peckham .
12,6,6,He plays outside right but it doesn't mean he has to stand on the right .
13,1,6,Sorry  but do not worry . I think I can fix it . Just cut a little more off the temple .
14,6,6,Do it  please .
672 12
 (6, 4),(8, 4),(8, 7),(10, 4),(10, 7),(12, 11),
1,6,6,Oh  hi  Jessica  are you going to see this movie too ?
2,6,6,I'd love to  the movies are smash hit .
3,6,6,Then let's go in .
4,6,6,I can't . I'm waiting for Paul  but he's late .
5,6,6,I'll say the movie's starting in the minute .
6,1,6,I know . I wonder what's keeping him .
7,6,6,Looks like he won't show up . He's done this before  hasn't he ?
8,1,6,Yeah  a number of times .
9,6,6,What's he trying to pull anyway .
10,1,6,I don't know . But this is definitely the last straw .
11,6,6,Maybe you should start seeing someone else .
12,0,6,You said it . Ok  let's go in  Sandy .
10408 12
 (7, 6),(8, 7),(10, 6),(12, 6),
1,6,6,Hello . I am calling about the apartment you advertised .
2,6,6,Yes  what kind of apartment are you interested in ?
3,6,6,I am interested in one-bedroom . Do you have any available ?
4,6,6,Yes  I have one . When you need it ?
5,6,6,Sometime around next week . What can you tell me about this apartment ?
6,6,6,Well  It's a one-bedroom apartment . The monthly rent at 650 dollars and a 300 dollars security deposit . You pay electricity only . Gas and water is included . Both the heat and stove are gas . Let me see  what else ... Oh  you'll be assigned a sheltered parking space at no extra charge . And that's probably it .
7,0,6,Sounds good . May I come over tomorrow to take a look ?
8,0,6,Sure . What time would you like to come ?
9,6,6,How about 10 am ?
10,0,6,Good  May I have your name  please ?
11,6,6,My name is Blanca .
12,0,6,Thanks for calling  Blanca . I'll see you tomorrow .

 (4, 4),(5, 5),(6, 4),(6, 6),(6, 6),
1,6,6,Look  Jim . That man just fell down over there .
2,6,6,We'd better see if he is ok .
3,6,6,Sir  sir  are you all right  sir ?
4,4,6,He is not answering . You'd better check his pulse and breathing .
5,3,6,Oh  no . He is not breathing and there ' s no pulse . Call 911 .
6,4,6,Hello ? Yes  someone has passed out at Dongle Ave . and 2nd street . He isn't breathing and doesn't have a pulse . Yes  my friend is performing CPR . Ok  thank you . They are sending an ambulance . Here  let me help .

1,0,6,You bet it is . And we got four thousand for our car space ! Awesome !
2,0,6,Let's play some music ! I feel like dancing .
3,0,6,That's just what was running through my mind . Moonlight and dancing .
4,0,6,Ahh ! Now that's more like it . Atmosphere !
5,0,6,Come on baby  let's dance !
6,3,6,Oops ! It's the landlord . I guess the tables have turned now . We're the noisy neighbors . Turn it down !

1,6,6,Hi  I come to pick up my laundry . This is the invoice .
2,6,6,Here you are . We've ironed them for you already . Please check and see if there is any damage .
3,6,6,I'm afraid that a button is missing .
4,1,6,I'm terribly sorry . You know we are so busy today and we forget to sew the button back on . Please wait a moment . It will be ready soon .
5,6,6,OK  please .
6,6,6,Would you like to have a look ? Is it to your satisfaction ?
7,3,6,Well  oh my God  there is another problem  I'm afraid . There is still a stain on the shirt .
8,1,6,It doesn't seem like that . Sorry  sir  we've tried everything  but we're not able to get it off the shirt . It was from the sugar I think .
9,6,6,It's been several days now  I am not sure .
10,6,6,Yes  the sugar was burnt during the dry-cleaning process . And there you go .
11,6,6,Oh  that's so bad . I know little about that . Is there a remedy for it ?
12,1,6,I am awfully sorry . Please tell us about the stains before the dry-cleaning next time .
13,6,6,OK  I will .
14,6,6,This is a membership card . You can get a 20 percent discount next time .
15,0,6,Thanks a lot .
16,0,6,Hope to see you again . We will provide the best service .

1,0,6,I enjoy the folk song and dance show very much .
2,0,6,I'm glad you appreciate our folk music . But a live performance is much more interesting .
3,6,6,I can't wait anymore . When does the performance start ?
4,6,6,The show starts at 7 and is over at around 10 o'clock p . m .
5,6,6,( After the show ) It's an excellent musical . The acting was very expressive and the songs and dancing were superb .
6,0,6,I'm glad you enjoyed it . It's had long run  but the house has always been full .
7,6,6,What do you think of the leading actors ?
8,0,6,Personally I liked the main character . He was true to type .
9,6,6,You are a better judge . I don't know the play well enough .
9626 14
 (2, 1),(2, 1),(7, 6),(9, 1),(9, 1),(14, 6),
1,6,6,Hi  I'm back ! Hmm ... your hair is pretty damaged  and you've got split ends .
2,3,6,Really ? What can I do ?
3,6,6,Well  the trim should fix the split ends  but you might need a deep conditioning treatment .
4,6,6,Umm  OK . Whatever you think will help .
5,6,6,I'm also going to add some layers to frame your face .
6,6,6,Can you use the thinning shears on top  too ? My hair is really thick .
7,0,6,No problem !
8,6,6,Hi  I'm back ! Hmm ... your hair is pretty damaged  and you've got split ends .
9,3,6,Really ? What can I do ?
10,6,6,Well  the trim should fix the split ends  but you might need a deep conditioning treatment .
11,6,6,Umm  OK . Whatever you think will help .
12,6,6,I'm also going to add some layers to frame your face .
13,6,6,Can you use the thinning shears on top  too ? My hair is really thick .

8,1,6,That's terrible .
9,6,6,I am sorry to say this  sir  but you should've been more careful .
10,1,6,I apologize for that . But the space is too small .
11,6,6,What about the damage to my car ? What are you gonna do about that ?
12,6,6,Can we solve this later ? I am calling the insurance company .

1,6,6,Are you OK ?
2,1,6,I'm fine . I'm just so touched by the sad story .
3,6,6,So I can say now that you must have enjoyed the opera . Which scene is your favorite ?
4,6,6,I love them all . But if I had to name one as the best  I would say it's the ending .
5,6,6,What's it about ? You know  I couldn't help falling asleep .
6,3,6,Did you ? I didn't notice that . But still you should know it  for you have seen it with Laura before .
7,6,6,I guess I've done the same thing last time I was here with her  too . I mean falling asleep . For me  this one is not that attractive .
8,6,6,Then I doubt if you like operas at all .
9,6,6,Yes . I like Carmen very much . But I don't mind if you want to tell me about this one .
10,6,6,OK  then . The man was old and he was visiting his wife's grave  with a rose in his hand . When he got there  he saw someone already put a rose on her grave .
11,0,6,Very impressive . And I do like the leading actress who has an amazing voice .
12,0,6,Me  too . There was always a good round of applause every time she sings .
13,0,6,Yes  the applause ! That was what kept waking me up during the show .
14,0,6,And it's been such a faultless performance with the perfect lighting  and music . Just amazing !
15,0,6,No doubt  it's not a simple thing to put on a ' phantom show ' .
16,0,6,Exactly .

1,5,6,Ah ! No ! Damn it !
2,6,6,It's a blackout . Now I can't see Seinfeld .
3,6,6,So what ? I just lost one hour's worth of work .
4,3,6,Really ? How could you do that ? Don't you save every couple minutes ?
5,5,6,No  I didn't save this time . Damn it ! And I'm sick of writing this paper . Now I have to write it all over again too .
6,6,6,I've had that problem too many times . So I learned to save . When I'm writing something  I save every three sentences or so . I don't want to lose anything .
7,6,6,I hate computers . Sometimes I think they cause more trouble than they're worth .
8,6,6,What are we going to do now ?
9,6,6,I don't know . I feel like going out .
10,6,6,I wonder how much of the city is down .
11,6,6,It doesn't matter . I still can go out and buy a beer .
12,6,6,Maybe . But if there's a blackout  probably the pubs are closed . And besides  I know you have a political science exam tomorrow . I thought you had a lot of reading to do .
13,5,6,Yes  that's true . Damn ! I just lost half my paper  and now I can't even do my homework . This is a bad time for this to happen .
14,6,6,I have a flashlight in my closet . If you want to use that to read  you can .
15,0,6,Thanks . I think I will try . Where are you going ?
16,6,6,I like your idea of getting a beer . I think I'll go out myself .
17,6,6,Maybe we can trade . Why don't you stay here and read for my exam  and I'll go drink beer ?
18,6,6,No  it just won't work . If I read for your exam  you won't know the answers tomorrow . I will .
19,6,6,So ? You can go to the class for me . Just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . Why not ?
20,6,6,How many students are in the class ?
21,6,6,About fourteen .
22,6,6,So it won't work  old buddy . They'll see that I'm not you . Sorry .

4,3,6,Why ? You are so excellent . I think you are the most suitable person for the job .
5,6,6,Yes  I know I am excellent  but I pay no attention to the etiquette you ' Ve told me .
6,3,6,What ? Then what did you do ?
7,6,6,When I entered the room  I forgot to close the door . Later  I couldn ' t help smoking  you know I am a heavy-smoker . What ' s more  I forgot to polish my shoes . There is some dirt on it .
8,6,6,You are so careless . You know they are the basic rules you should follow before you attend an interview . Do remember not to smoke any more  otherwise  you can ' t find a job .
9,6,6,Yes  I know . And next time I must make good preparations .
10,6,6,Good luck next time .

2,6,6,Yes  and I want to buy the insurance too . I think it's necessary .
3,0,6,You're smart to buy it . At 45 dollars for three days  it is a good deal .
4,6,6,Can I return the car in San Francisco ?
5,6,6,San Francisco ? No  sir . We only have this office here . You will have to return it here .
6,3,6,Really ? I heard in America you can return rental cars in different cities .
7,6,6,No  sir . That's only with the very big companies . I'm sorry  but this car must be returned to this lot .
8,6,6,Well  I guess I will have to drive back down then . Hmm . I didn't think of that .

3,6,6,All right . If you need any help  just let me know . My name is Greg .
4,0,6,Sure  I'll let you know if I need anything . Hm  this mattress is very firm . Jack will probably like it .
5,6,6,Did you find something you like ?
6,0,6,Yes  this mattress is very good . It's pretty firm . The mattress I ' m now sleeping on is saggy .
7,6,6,You are right . This is very good brand . It doesn't sag easily and we offer a lifetime warranty  so you don't have to worry about its quality .
8,6,6,Does it come with a frame ?
9,6,6,Unfortunately  it doesn't . However we can give you a 10 % discount on the frame . We also offer a very good financing plan . There is no payment no interest until next June .
10,0,6,That's an attractive plan . I'll think about it .

1,0,6,Thank you for coming tonight  Mrs . Webber . As a teacher  it's great seeing the kid's parents assist our parent-teacher conference night .
2,0,6,Of course ! I am very interested to know how my child is doing and also get some insight from you as to how he can improve .
3,0,6,Well Allen is a great student . He is a hard worker and very well behaved  however he does struggle a bit with math .
4,6,6,I guess he gets that from me  I never did well in math when I was a kid . What can I do at home to compliment what he is learning in the classroom .
5,6,6,Well  it's important that you sit with him and review his homework assignments and help him with math . I would also recommend he stay after school twice a week for tutoring sessions . It will really help a lot .
6,0,6,Thanks a lot ! I will definitely do that . Is there anything else ?
7,6,6,Um ... yes . Here is a notice from our financial department  seems your child's Tumion is overdue .

1,6,6,Ah ! It hurts . Don't touch it .
2,6,6,What part hurts ?
3,6,6,The shoulder .
4,6,6,Well  maybe you broke it . But what I'm worried about is this cut .
5,4,6,It's not a cut . It's a gash ! It's bigger than a cut ! Ah ! I need a doctor .
6,6,6,C'mon . Just don't move .
7,4,6,I'm bleeding too much .
8,6,6,We don't have a decent First Aid Kit  do we ?
9,4,6,Yes . My bike has one under the seat . Get it  quick !
10,6,6,There's some tape  iodine  and cloth bandages . I don't think the cloth bandages can stop the bleeding . What we need is a tourniquet .
11,6,6,Wrap a few loops of the bandages around my upper arm  then twist . That will work as a tourniquet . After that  you can cut more of the bandages to cover the wound .
12,0,6,Good plan . Let me put some iodine on the cut .
13,4,6,No  forget that ! Do the tourniquet first . I'm losing too much blood .
14,6,6,Alright  alright . How did you cut this so bad ?
15,5,6,I ran it against that fence pole as I crashed . What do you think ? Damn  it hurts !
16,6,6,We'll have to get you to a hospital . I can ride you on the back of my bike .
17,6,6,I'm lucky I wasn't killed . I must have been going around forty-five miles an hour . There was too much gravel on that corner . I slid out .
18,6,6,Yes  I almost slid too . Alright . This tourniquet is tight . How does it feel ?
19,6,6,Make it tighter . I want the blood stopped . Then wrap some bandages around the cut . Then we can go . Ouch ! I hope I can walk .
20,6,6,Alright  I'm twisting it around . You tell me when to stop .
21,6,6,There . Stop !

1,6,6,How do you arrange this summer vacation ?
2,6,6,I want to travel .
3,6,6,Where would you like to go ?

1,6,6,My friend Emily recently lost 18 pounds .
2,3,6,Oh  really ?
3,6,6,The point is that she has been persuading me to lose weight too .
4,6,6,Well  it's a good thing for you .
5,3,6,Good ? Yes  it's good for her but not for me . You see  she tells me that I'll feel better about myself if I slim down . She keeps giving me newspaper clippings about the latest miracle diet and insists that I join a health club  as she has .
6,3,6,So you don't think you are fat and need to lose weight ?
7,6,6,I just can't bear it that Emily made me feel like a baby who always pigs out on junk food .
8,6,6,junk food is not good for your health . Too much of it will make you fat .
9,6,6,But junk food is so easy . It requires no silverware or plates  no rigid mealtimes  no pleases and thank yous .
10,6,6,Ok  but junk food has many disadvantages . As junk food contains high amount of oil and fat  you'll feel sleepy  but not be able to concentrate when you have a lot of it .
11,6,6,Yes  but life without chips  ice cream and coca cola is boring .
12,6,6,Let me see . You could exercise more to keep fit .
13,6,6,Well  that sounds better than giving it up .
891 11
 (4, 3),(9, 9),(11, 10),
1,6,6,Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ?
2,6,6,Sorry  I thought you knew .
3,6,6,But you should tell me you were in love with her .
4,3,6,Didn't I ?
5,6,6,You know you didn't .
6,6,6,Well  I am telling you now .
7,6,6,Yes  but you might have told me before .
8,6,6,I didn't think you would be interested .
9,5,6,You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you are going to marry her ?
10,6,6,Sorry  I didn't think it mattered .
11,5,6,Oh  you men ! You are all the same .

8,0,6,No  I have visited China several times  but it's my first visit to Beijing and I think it's a great honor to be invited to your beautiful city .

9,6,6,We have this beautiful platinum pendant  or you could also get her a locket . You could also get her a timepiece -- it ' s both glamorous yet functional . If you tell me a little more about your girlfriend  maybe I can help you find something for her .
10,6,6,Jess ? Well  she ' s very smart  and has a great sense of humor . She ' s very feminine ...
11,6,6,Perhaps you could give her a ring ?
12,6,6,Well ... actually ... I was thinking about asking Jess to marry me ... I ' Ve just been so nervous .
13,0,6,Well sir  I believe your fifth anniversary is a great time to propose !
14,0,6,Okay  I ' Ve decided . I ' m going to pop the question !
15,0,6,Fabulous ! We should look at engagement rings then ! Now that ' s a whole other section .

1,0,6,Oh  hey  Keri ! You cook  right ! You're a pretty good cook .
2,6,6,I'm OK .
3,6,6,I want to make an omelet  so actually this is really silly  I've never made one before . How do you make an omelet ?
4,6,6,Well  I can teach you how I make them  which is the same way my father and grandmother make them  which is a little special .
5,0,6,OK . Yeah ! Yeah !
6,6,6,First you take some eggs and crack them in a bowl  and whisk them up  quite  so they're quite high and fluffy  and in a hot pan  and you need a pan that's that's kind of small  that the sides go up at an angle . You put some oil and heat it up  so it's quite hot  and then you take your whipped up eggs  or whisked up eggs  and pour them into the pan  and as it's cooking  if you take a spatula  and push the bottom layer of the egg  to the side  to the sides  and then to the middle  so the uncooked egg gets to the bottom of the pan .
7,0,6,Oh  OK . Wow !
8,6,6,OK . And keep doing that until most of the egg is cooked so you should have a nice thick omelet and then flip it over  you'll only have to cook that side lightly . Put your fillings on the top and fold it over and let it sit just long enough to melt the cheese .
9,0,6,Wow . That sounds really good .

 (1, 1),(4, 4),(8, 8),(10, 10),(11, 10),(11, 11),

2,6,6,Beauty costs  dear ! What do you think of this dress ? Do you think it suits me ?
3,6,6,yeah  it's lovely  but to be frank  it's not the most practical . You don't have many formal events in your calendar  do you ?
4,0,6,come on  you sound like my Mom . Look at that  it's beautiful !
5,6,6,when you buy clothes  you must think about the material  quality and price .
6,6,6,maybe you have a point .
7,6,6,make sure you buy what you need and your clothes can be worn for various occasions .
8,0,6,all right . How about this black shirt ? It can be worn for anything---a party  a job interview and even a funeral !
9,6,6,that's true  but you already have two back coats and one black sweater .
10,0,6,oh ! Hey  look  that's the same shirt Britney wore in her concert .
11,0,6,exactly ! Oh  my god ! I love Britney ! I'm going to get it .
12,6,6,why not try it on ?
13,6,6,it's just the right size--a perfect fit ! I'll take it . Oh  no  I'm a little short . Did you bring your credit card ?
14,6,6,yes .
15,6,6,I promise I'll pay you back as soon as we get home .

2,1,6,My girlfriend just broke up with me .
3,6,6,You must feel terrible now .
4,1,6,Yeah .
5,6,6,I remember my first break up . It was the worst feeling in the world . I was crying everyday for three months . And slowly  it got better . I know you'll feel better too .
6,3,6,You've been through this too ?
7,6,6,Yeah . I remember it very clearly . The pain makes it easy to remember . I know you're really hurting right now  but you know many people experience break ups .
8,1,6,But it hurts too much .
9,6,6,I know it's painful  but it's only temporary . After the pain goes away  you'll find other girls .
10,6,6,What if I don't want to find another girl ?
11,6,6,You'll change your mind . Look at everyone in the world . They all break up and move on . The faster you understand this  the quicker you will recover .
12,0,6,You're right .
13,0,6,I also know you must still have strong feelings for her  but try to think of all the bad things . You know she didn't treat you that well . Is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with ?
14,0,6,Yeah . Thanks for the talk .
15,0,6,I'll give you a call later . We should hang out . It's good to be around people .

1,6,6,Why don't you watch where you're going ?
2,3,6,Me ? You're the one who pulled out in front of me !
3,6,6,There was plenty of room for me to pull out . You didn't have to stay in the lane you were in .
4,5,6,Hey  listen . I had every right to stay in the lane I was in . You were supposed to wait until I passed to pull out . And anyhow  you didn't give me any time to change lanes . All of a sudden--BANG--there you are right in front of me .
5,6,6,I think my arm is broken .
6,6,6,Sorry about your arm  but it serves you right . You need to learn how to drive . You're lucky you didn't get killed . And I'm lucky to be alive too .
7,6,6,Listen  let's just wait until the police get here . Then we can decide whose fault this accident was .
8,6,6,Fine with me . I know the laws of the road . I'm not worried .
9,6,6,I have a cell phone in my car . Now it's probably on the floor on the passenger side . Why don't you get it for me  and then I can call the police ?
10,6,6,Alright .
11,6,6,It doesn't work . It looks like it's broken . I need to get to a hospital . You should drive me there .
12,3,6,Oh  yeah ? It's better if we make a police report first . Then you can go to the hospital .
13,5,6,Damn it ! I'm injured here . We could wait all day for the police .
14,6,6,Well  you'll just have to wait . I'm not going to move my car until the police arrive . I'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone . Don't worry . You'll get to the hospital in time .
15,6,6,It really hurts .
16,6,6,Yes  maybe it does . But if you're going to drive like you did just now  you will have to get used to a little physical pain . You know what I mean ?
17,5,6,To hell with you . The accident was your fault .
18,6,6,I'm afraid it wasn't . And when the police get here  you will also see that it wasn't . But enough of this bickering . I'm going to go find a phone . Don ' t move that arm while I'm gone . Alright ?
19,5,6,To hell with you .

1,3,6,Look ! Allen has the mic !
2,6,6,I thought he only liked to listen !
3,3,6,That was before he heard Stanley sing ! I guess he couldn't stand it any more  so he decided to give it a try himself !

2,0,6,Sure ! What do you feel like having ?
3,0,6,I really feel like having a big juicy steak !
4,6,6,Oh . OK . I don't eat meat  but that's fine  I am sure wherever we are going they will have other options right ?
5,3,6,I didn't know you were a vegetarian !
6,6,6,I'm not  I am a vegan .
7,3,6,A what ?
8,6,6,A vegan . I don't eat or use any animal based products . I don't wear leather  eat eggs  drink milk or anything that comes from an animal . I used to be a pescatarian before  which basically means you don't eat meat  but still have fish and seafood .
9,0,6,Wow ! That's interesting ! It must be tough !
10,6,6,It's a bit difficult to find vegetarian friendly restaurants sometimes  but since more and more people are vegetarians or vegans nowadays  it's getting a bit less difficult .

2,0,6,yeah  I'm glad that we didn't have to wait long . I'm starving !
3,6,6,let's take a look at the menu so we can order . Do you want to choose an appetizer for us to share ?
4,6,6,what would you rather have  samosas or poppadoms ?
5,6,6,I heard that one of their specialities is the samosa .
6,6,6,well  let's get a plate of those then .
7,6,6,sounds good . What are you going to have for your main course ?
8,6,6,I think I might have a dahl .
9,6,6,what's in a dahl ?
10,6,6,it's got chickpeas and vegetables in a spicy curry sauce with rice .
11,0,6,that sounds nice . Do you want to share some kebabs as well ?
12,6,6,ok . How about some lamb kebabs ?
13,0,6,that's my favourite . Do you want to have some wine or beer ?
14,6,6,I think I'll have a beer .
15,6,6,ok  shall I flag down the waitress ?
16,6,6,I wouldn't recommend it . I think we should wait until she comes round .
17,0,6,you're right . That might seem a bit rude . It's a good thing I've got you with me !
18,6,6,what would you do without me ?

2,6,6,I ' m sorry  we have no mid-size available at the moment .
3,6,6,I don ' t understand  I made a reservation  do you have my reservation ?
4,6,6,Yes  we do  unfortunately we ran out of cars .
5,5,6,But the reservation keeps the car here . That ' s why you have the reservation .
6,6,6,I know why we have reservations .
7,5,6,I don ' t think you do . If you did  I ' d have a car . See  you know how to take the reservation  you just don ' t know how to hold the reservation and that ' s really the most important part of the reservation  the holding . Anybody can just take them .
8,6,6,But we do have a compact or an SUV if you ' d like .
9,5,6,Fine . I ' ll take the compact .
10,6,6,Alright . We have a blue Ford Focus for you  Mr . Fox . Would you like insurance ?

4,6,6,Anything that distracts you from work ?
5,1,6,Yes  everything . I feel overwhelmed by the daily work . Sometimes  I just can ' t focus on what I am doing . What is worse  though I make plans for a whole week  I always have to make changes later on because other things come up . I can ' t manage my time well . I can ' t handle work well . I am afraid I was screw up more things .
6,6,6,Look  Lucy . Things are not so bad as you said . This is our company ' s busiest time in a year . You need to relax a little . Don ' t push yourself too hard  ok ?

1,6,6,Hi  Dan . What's new ?
2,6,6,Where have you been ? I've been trying to get in touch with you for two days .
3,6,6,I went to Salt Lake City on business . What's up ?
4,1,6,I got fired .
5,3,6,How come ? Last time I saw you . You told me it was a good job  and you'd like to take it as a career . That was only one month ago . Why this sudden change ?
6,1,6,It's a long story . In a word  I didn't do a good job of it . I messed up a business deal  a deal that would have made ten million dollars and I messed it up .
7,6,6,What are you going to do now ?
8,6,6,I am trying to find a job asap . Lily doesn't know yet . I didn't tell her . I spent the past three days at the coffee shop next to your office  and she thought I went to work as usual .
9,6,6,That's not the way to solve the problem . Did you look in the classified advertisements column ?
10,6,6,Yes  I did . But I wasn't qualified for most of the jobs that I was interested in .
11,6,6,Listen . I will see what I can do  ok ? You go home and tell Lily about this problem you have now . She is your wife and I am sure she will understand .
12,1,6,I just don't know how to bring it up . Well  all right . She has the right to know anyways .

2,0,6,Wow  fantastic . I like the font and color for his name . It is creative yet personal .
3,0,6,Yes  it is a bold design . People will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . It just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .
4,0,6,I agree . Business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . It won ' t take much time to design an amazing card  but it can make a big difference among the crowd . And you ' ll always notice it from your collection . For they have outspoken colors  own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . I wish to have one like this . But for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow .

4,6,6,I just sense . But I cannot grow anymore . My boss is not really supporting me . I am interested in some positions in other JV companies  but I need to do some more in-depth research before I send my application letters out .
5,0,6,That is important . Doing research on a company you are interested in will definitely help your application .

5,6,6,let's see how much the bill is .
6,6,6,don't worry about it . Tonight is my treat .
7,6,6,what are you talking about ? We'll split the bill .
8,6,6,no  I insist . I kept telling you that I would treat you to dinner but I still haven't .
9,6,6,no way  Gordon . I know that you are a little short on cash at the moment . There's no need for you to pay for the whole bill .
10,6,6,alright  if that's the way you are going to be  we'll split the bill .
11,6,6,that's better . This way we will both have money to take a cab home  otherwise  you would probably have to walk .
12,6,6,just promise you will let me treat you to dinner next week  ok ?

2,6,6,Me ? You're the one who pulled out in front of me !
3,5,6,There was plenty of room for me to pull out . You didn't have to stay in the lane you were in .
4,6,6,Hey  listen . I had every right to stay in the lane I was in . You were supposed to wait until I passed to pull out . And anyhow  you didn't give me any time to change lanes . All of a sudden--BANG--there you are right in front of me .
5,6,6,I think my arm is broken .
6,6,6,Sorry about your arm  but it serves you right . You need to learn how to drive . You're lucky you didn't get killed . And I'm lucky to be alive too .
7,6,6,Listen  let's just wait until the police get here . Then we can decide whose fault this accident was .
8,6,6,Fine with me . I know the laws of the road . I'm not worried .
9,6,6,I have a cell phone in my car . Now it's probably on the floor on the passenger side . Why don't you get it for me  and then I can call the police ?
10,6,6,Alright .
11,5,6,It doesn't work . It looks like it's broken . I need to get to a hospital . You should drive me there .
12,6,6,Oh  yeah ? It's better if we make a police report first . Then you can go to the hospital .
13,5,6,Damn it ! I'm injured here . We could wait all day for the police .
14,6,6,Well  you'll just have to wait . I'm not going to move my car until the police arrive . I'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone . Don't worry . You'll get to the hospital in time .
15,5,6,It really hurts .
16,6,6,Yes  maybe it does . But if you're going to drive like you did just now  you will have to get used to a little physical pain . You know what I mean ?
17,5,6,To hell with you . The accident was your fault .
18,6,6,I'm afraid it wasn't . And when the police get here  you will also see that it wasn't . But enough of this bickering . I'm going to go find a phone . Don ' t move that arm while I'm gone . Alright ?
19,5,6,To hell with you .

1,6,6,Hi Barbara . Have you lost weight ?
2,6,6,Hi Julie . Yeah . I've been on a diet for a couple of months now .
3,6,6,Wow . You look great .
4,0,6,Thanks for noticing .
5,6,6,What type of diet were you on ?
6,6,6,I joined a health club and my trainer gave me tips on eating . With a combination of eating better and exercising  I managed to lose 15 pounds in 2 months .
7,0,6,That's amazing . What tips did your trainer give you ?
8,6,6,Mostly on how to exercise  but the best advice I got was changing my eating habits . Instead of eating 3 times a day  she told me to eat 5 times a day .
9,6,6,That doesn't make sense . If you eat more  than how do you lose weight ?
10,6,6,Actually  I'm eating the same amount . I eat 5 smaller meals a day . Basically  it naturally speeds up the metabolism and helps to burn fat at a faster rate .
11,6,6,That makes sense . I'm going to try that .
12,6,6,You don't need to lose weight .
13,6,6,I have a little gut I have been trying to get rid of .
14,6,6,Ah ... but remember to incorporate a little exercise into your diet .
15,0,6,Thanks for the advice .

3,6,6,Why ? Looks like you're feeling very down ! What happened ?
4,1,6,Nothing .
5,6,6,Come on . For a man who's feeling so  down  there're usually two reasons . Either his career is going downhill  or he has a broken heart . Since you're so successful  it must be the latter .
6,1,6,Well  you're right . I just broke up with Jane .
7,6,6,Oh  I'm sorry . I thought you two were made for each ocher .
8,1,6,Well  you never know . I'm ready for a commitment and want to settle down  but she says she wants to pursue her career while she's still young .
9,6,6,Well  she is not to blame . It's always difficult to choose between career and family .
10,1,6,Maybe you're right .
11,6,6,Jack  I don't know what to say to comfort you  but cheer up ! There are plenty of fish in the sea and you'll find your soul mate  your perfect match !

9,6,6,I had a worker like that once . She was always taking credit for my ideas .
