3,null,null,to become a man of wealth and influence such as Monsieur Vigo
4,fear,fear,and ( I fear I loved it best ) to match my brains with others at a bargain
5,null,null,I turned it all over slowly
6,null,null,gravely
7,null,null,in my boyish mind
8,null,null,rubbing the hard dirt on the floor with the toe of my moccasin .
237 5
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,This furnished Madame de Fondege with another excuse for proffering her advice
2,null,null,But Mademoiselle Marguerite would not allow herself to be convinced at once
3,null,null,She raised a great many objections
4,happiness,happiness,and parleyed for a long time before telling Madame de Fondege that she would be happy to accept the hospitality which had been offered her
5,null,null,And her consent was by no means unconditional .
238 10
 (3, 9),
1,null,null,Fortunat 's address must be there
2,null,null,so she asked and obtained permission to examine this notebook
3,happiness,to her great joy,and to her great joy
4,null,null,under the letter  "  F
5,null,null,"   she found the entry :   "  Fortunat ( Isidore )

9,null,happiness,im sure that I shall find Pascal now
10,null,null,"   she exclaimed .
240 4
 (1, 1),
1,fear,fear,It was easy to see by Madame de Fondege 's earnestness that she feared Mademoiselle Marguerite would avail herself of this opportunity of recovering her liberty
2,null,null,"  What shall I do
3,null,null,then
4,null,null,"   asked the girl .
247 6
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,He was in all the greater haste as it was Sunday
2,null,null,Fortunat was in the habit of passing these days in the country
3,fear,fear,and Chupin feared he might fail to see him if he was not expeditious in his movements
4,null,null,And while running to the Place de la Bourse
5,null,null,he carefully prepared the story he meant to relate
6,null,null,deeply impressed by the wisdom of the popular maxim which says :   "  It is not always well to tell the whole truth .  "
249 16
 (11, 9),
1,null,null,However
2,null,null,the effect of this discovery was to dispel his anger
3,null,null,or rather to restore his calmness
4,null,null,and
5,null,null,addressing M
6,null,null,de Coralth
7,null,null,he exclaimed :   "  dont be angry at what i 've said

12,null,null,But im not so very bad looking

15,null,null,Some people have such luck

1,null,null,What if he knew that there 's a fortune waiting for a claimant
2,surprise,surprise,I should n't at all be surprised if I found that he wanted to cook his bread in our oven
3,null,null,But father Fortunat would n't be pleased with the news .
255 6
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Having come with the intention of offering his agent a handsome sum
2,surprise,surprise,he was agreeably surprised to find that Chupin 's scruples would enable him to save his money
3,null,null,"  If I had not found you engaged in study
4,null,null,Victor
5,null,null,"   he said
6,null,null,"  I should have thought you had been drinking .
256 6
 (2, 3),
1,null,null,Fortunat was amazed
2,anger,annoyed,and at the same time much annoyed
3,null,anger,to find himself forsaken on account of such a trifle
4,null,null,He feared

6,null,fear,that Chupin might let his tongue wag if he left his employment
7,null,null,So
8,null,null,since he had confided this project to Chupin
9,null,null,he was determined that Chupin alone should carry it into execution .
258 6
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,If any one heard them
2,null,null,no one came
3,null,null,still they recalled Pascal to a sense of the situation
4,sadness,sadness,and he was ashamed of his violence
5,null,null,He released Madame Leon
6,null,null,and his manner suddenly became as humble as it had been threatening .

3,null,null,She threatened her brother
4,null,null,but she would never have carried her threats into execution .
267 6
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,There was but one certain and positive thing
2,null,null,and this was that the money he had counted upon had escaped him
3,null,null,and he experienced as acute a pang as if he had lost forty thousand francs a second time
4,null,null,Perhaps
5,null,null,at that moment
6,sadness,sadness,he was sorry that he had severed his connection with the marquis .
294 7
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,But M
2,null,null,Fortunat had resolved to listen to nothing
3,null,null,He wished for no explanations
4,fear,fear,so distrustful was he of himself so much did he fear that his adventurous nature would urge him to incur further risk
5,null,null,He was positively afraid of the Marquis de Valorsay 's eloquence
6,null,null,besides
7,null,null,he knew well enough that the person who consents to listen is at least half convinced .

9,null,null,I came to town for that purpose

5,null,null,I hastened there
6,surprise,surprised,very much surprised

 (4, 5),

399 7
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,As a rule

11,null,null,"  If you dont
12,null,null,I shall run to the nearest stand .  "
403 11
 (7, 10),
1,null,null,Fortunat 's countenance wore an expression of profound commiseration
2,null,null,A looker on would have supposed him interested and sympathetic to the last degree
3,null,null,but in reality
4,null,null,he was furious
5,null,null,Time was passing
6,null,null,and the conversation was wandering farther and farther from the object of his visit

404 10
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,Isidore Fortunat was literally upon the rack
2,null,null,and to make his sufferings still more horrible
3,null,null,he dared not ask any direct question
4,null,null,nor allow his curiosity to become manifest
5,fear,fear,for fear of alarming the woman
6,null,null,"  Let me see

 (4, 5),

407 13
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,It was the old
2,null,null,sad story of a ruined girl paying for a moment 's madness with her happiness and all her after life
3,null,null,A terrible drama
4,null,null,no doubt
5,null,null,but one that is of such frequent occurrence that it seems as commonplace as life itself
6,null,null,Thus any one who was acquainted with M
7,surprise,surprise,Isidore Fortunat would have been surprised to see how greatly he was moved by such a trifle
8,null,null,"  Poor girl

10,null,null,in view of saying something
11,null,null,And then
12,null,null,in a tone of assumed carelessness
13,null,null,he inquired :    "  Did they never discover what scoundrel carried Mademoiselle de Chalusse away

3,null,null,Such a man
4,null,null,as cold and as smooth as a hundred franc piece

7,null,null,while he was compelled to conceal his grief at the loss of his forty thousand francs
8,null,null,deep in the recesses of his heart
9,null,null,So

1,null,null,He had barely strength enough to throw himself on to the bed
2,null,null,and in a moment he was sleeping with that heavy slumber which so often seizes hold of one on the occasion of a great crisis
3,null,null,and which has so frequently been observed among persons condemned to death
4,null,null,on the night preceding their execution
5,null,null,Four or five times his mother came to listen at the door
6,null,null,Once she entered
7,null,null,and seeing her son sleeping soundly
8,null,null,she could not repress a smile of satisfaction
9,null,null,"  Poor Pascal
10,null,null,"   she thought
11,null,sadness,"  he can bear no excess but excess of work
12,null,null,Heavens
13,sadness,mortified,how surprised and mortified  he will be when he awakes
436 13
 (11, 9),
1,null,null,Contrary to his usual custom
2,null,null,he took the little staircase on the right
3,null,null,leading to the grand vestibule
4,null,null,where several lawyers were assembled
5,null,null,earnestly engaged in conversation
6,null,null,They were evidently astonished to see Pascal
7,null,null,and their conversation abruptly ceased on his approach
8,null,null,They assumed a grave look and turned away their heads in disgust
9,null,sadness,The unfortunate man at once realized the truth
10,null,null,and pressed his hand to his forehead
11,sadness,despairing,with a despairing gesture
12,null,null,as he murmured :   "  Already
13,null,null,already

 (3, 3),
1,null,null,Pascal read as follows :   "  There was great sensation and a terrible scandal last night at the residence of Madame d' a
2,null,null,a well-known star of the first magnitude
3,happiness,happiness,A score of gentlemen of high rank and immense wealth were enjoying a quiet game of baccarat
4,null,null,when it was observed that M
5,null,null,F   was winning in a most extraordinary manner
6,null,null,He was watched and detected in the very act of dexterously slipping some cards into the pack he held .
442 20
 (15, 15),
1,null,null,Pascal was absorbed in thought
2,null,null,"  And what a strange coincidence
3,null,null,"   he eventually remarked
4,null,null,"  Do you know
5,null,null,the last time I saw Marguerite
6,null,null,a week ago
7,null,null,she seemed so sad and anxious that I felt alarmed
8,null,null,I questioned her
9,null,null,but at first she would not answer
10,null,null,After a little while
11,null,null,however
12,null,null,as I insisted
13,null,null,she said :  ' ah
14,null,null,well
15,fear,fear,I fear the count is planning a marriage for me
16,null,null,de Chalusse has not said a word to me on the subject
17,null,null,but he has recently had several long conferences in private with a young man whose father rendered him a great service in former years
18,null,null,And this young man
19,null,null,whenever I meet him
20,null,null,looks at me in such a peculiar manner
445 14
 (7, 4),(7, 5),
1,null,null,Meanwhile Madame Ferailleur and her son had exchanged significant glances
2,null,null,Their impressions were the same
3,null,null,This man could not be an enemy
4,null,happiness,When the baron had finished his letter
5,null,happiness,and had read it aloud
6,null,null,Pascal
7,happiness,deeply moved,who was deeply moved

11,null,null,pray dont send that note
12,null,null,It would cause you a great deal of trouble and annoyance

450 22
 (9, 4),
1,null,null,That was
2,null,null,indeed
3,null,null,what he desired
4,null,happiness,With the hand that was comparatively free
5,null,null,with the hoarse rattle that was his only voice
6,null,null,de Chalusse answered
7,null,null,"  Yes
8,null,null,yes
9,happiness,with an expression of joy and gratitude,"   and his eyes even turned to Madame Leon with an expression of joy and gratitude
10,null,null,They raised him on his pillows
11,null,null,and brought him a small writing - desk
12,null,null,with some paper
13,null,null,and a pen that had been dipped in ink
14,null,null,But like those around him
15,null,null,he had himself over estimated his strength
16,null,null,if he could move his hand
17,null,null,he could not CONTROL its movements
18,null,null,After a terrible effort and intense suffering
19,null,null,however
20,null,null,he succeeded in tracing a few words
21,null,null,the meaning of which it was impossible to understand
22,null,null,It was only with the greatest difficulty that these words could be deciphered  "  My entire fortune give friends against   "   This signified nothing .
451 6
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,"  My God
2,null,null,"   exclaimed Mademoiselle Marguerite
3,null,null,with a gesture of despair
4,null,null,"  what have I done
5,null,null,I have broken the key
6,fear,fear,I feared the responsibility which would fall upon us all .  "
455 19
 (8, 7),
1,null,null,Indeed
2,null,null,he was persuaded he was sure he would
3,null,null,in fact
4,null,null,have sworn that the Count de Chalusse had taken all the precautions natural in childless men
5,null,null,who have no near relatives to inherit their fortune
6,null,null,or who have placed their interest and affections beyond their family circle
7,null,anger,And when he was obliged to abandon his search
8,anger,anger,his gesture indicated anger rather than discouragement
9,null,null,for apparent evidence had not shaken his conviction in the least
10,null,null,So he stood motionless
11,null,null,with his eyes riveted on his ring
12,null,null,as if waiting some miraculous inspiration from it
13,null,null,"  For the count 's only fault
14,null,null,I am sure
15,null,null,was in being too cautious
16,null,null,"   he muttered
17,null,null,"  This is frequently the case
18,null,null,and it would be quite in keeping with the character of this man
19,null,null,judging from what I know of him .  "
463 17
 (6, 4),
1,null,null,What a change indeed
2,null,null,At last the count made me retire to one of the compartments
3,null,null,where I soon fell asleep
4,null,fear,abandoning my efforts to distinguish what was dreamlike in my situation from reality
5,null,null,However
6,fear,terribly anxious,when I woke up I became terribly anxious
7,null,null,I asked myself what was awaiting me at the end of this long journey
8,null,null,de Chalusse 's manner continued kind
9,null,null,and even affectionate
10,null,null,but he had regained his accustomed reserve and self-control
11,null,null,and I realized that it would be useless on my part to question him
12,null,null,At last
13,null,null,after a thirty hours ' journey by rail
14,null,null,we again entered the count 's berline
15,null,null,drawn by post horses
16,null,null,and eventually M
17,null,null,de Chalusse said to me :  ' here is Cannes we are at our journey 's end . '
464 27
 (12, 9),
1,null,null,He told me that he proposed spending a few months here in seclusion
2,null,null,so as to give me time to accustom myself to my new position and the luxury that surrounded me
3,null,null,I was
4,null,null,indeed
5,null,null,extremely awkward
6,null,null,and my excessive timidity was increased by my pride
7,null,null,I did not know what to say
8,null,null,or what to do
9,null,sadness,I did not know how to use my hands
10,null,null,nor how to walk
11,null,null,nor how to carry myself
12,sadness,embarrassed,Everything embarrassed and frightened me
13,null,null,and I was conscious of my awkwardness
14,null,null,without being able to remedy it
15,null,null,I saw my blunders
16,null,null,and knew that I spoke a different language to that which was spoken around me
17,null,null,And yet the memory of Cannes will ever be dear to me
18,null,null,For there I first met the only friend I have now left in this world
19,null,null,I did not exchange a word with him
20,null,null,but by the quickened throbbing s of my heart
21,null,null,when our eyes met
22,null,null,I felt that he would exert a powerful influence over my life
23,null,null,and events have since proved that I was not deceived
24,null,null,At that time
25,null,null,however
26,null,null,he was a stranger to me
27,null,null,and nothing on earth would have induced me to make inquiries concerning him .
465 22
 (11, 8),
1,null,null,"  By a single word the count could have insured the happiness of my life and his own
2,null,null,but he did not speak it
3,null,null,He was the kindest and most indulgent of guardians
4,null,null,and I was often affected to tears by his tenderness
5,null,null,But
6,null,null,although my slightest wish was law
7,null,null,he did not grant me his confidence
8,null,disgust,the mystery that stood between us was like a wall of ice  Still
9,null,null,I was gradually becoming accustomed to my new life
10,null,null,and my mind was regaining its equilibrium
11,disgust,more agitated and excited,when one evening the count returned home more agitated and excited
12,null,null,if possible
13,null,null,than on the day of my departure from the asylum
14,null,null,He summoned his valet
15,null,null,and
16,null,null,in a tone that admitted no reply
17,null,null,he exclaimed
18,null,null,' i wish to leave Cannes at once  I must start in less than an hour so procure some post horses instantly
19,null,null,And in answer to my inquiring glance
20,null,null,he said :  ' it must be
21,null,null,It would be folly to hesitate
22,null,null,Each moment increases the peril that threatens us . '
466 18
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,What mysterious freak of fate had caused him to pause there at that particular moment
2,null,null,This much is certain
3,null,null,he recognized me as I had recognized him
4,null,null,He bowed
5,null,null,smiling somewhat
6,null,null,and I fled indoors again
7,anger,anger,indignant with myself for not being angry at his audacity
8,null,null,I made many plans that day
9,null,null,but the next morning
10,null,null,at the same hour
11,null,null,I hid myself behind a Venetian blind
12,null,null,and saw him pause at the gate
13,null,null,and gaze at the garden with evident anxiety
14,null,null,I soon learned that he lived near by
15,null,null,with his widowed mother
16,null,null,and twice a day
17,null,null,when he went to the Palais de Justice and returned
18,null,null,he passed my home .  "
467 11
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,When that day comes I will go to your guardian and ask him for your hand
2,null,null,but in Heaven 's name dont speak now
3,null,null,I understood Pascal 's motives well enough
4,null,null,The count 's immense fortune frightened him
5,fear,fear,and he feared that he would be accused of being a fortune hunter
6,null,null,So I waited
7,null,null,with that secret anguish which still haunts those who have been unhappy even when their present is peaceful
8,null,null,and their future seems bright
9,null,null,I kept my secret
10,null,null,saying to myself that such happiness was not meant for me
11,null,null,that it would soon take flight .
469 21
 (11, 11),
1,null,null,A few moments ' conversation now and then
2,null,null,the exchange of a few letters
3,null,null,the pressure of a hand through the garden gate
4,null,null,and that is all
5,null,null,Still
6,null,null,I have been guilty of a grave and irreparable fault :  I have disobeyed the one rule of my life frankness
7,null,null,and I am cruelly punished for doing so
8,null,null,I did not tell all this to M
9,null,null,de Chalusse in fact
10,null,null,I dared not
11,sadness,sadness,I was ashamed of my cowardice
12,null,null,from day to day I vowed that I would confess everything
13,null,null,and yet I procrastinated
14,null,null,I said to myself every night
15,null,null,' it shall be done to-morrow
16,null,null,but when the morrow came I said
17,null,null,' i will give myself another day just one more day
18,null,null,Indeed
19,null,null,my courage failed me when I thought of the count 's aristocratic prejudices
20,null,null,and besides
21,null,null,I knew how ambitious he was for my future .
470 11
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,When that day comes I will go to your guardian and ask him for your hand
2,null,null,but in Heaven 's name dont speak now

471 7
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,I did not wish to bind him by the advice which he would certainly have given me
2,null,null,I had his troth
3,null,null,and that sufficed
4,null,null,And it was with a thrill of joy that I said to myself :  ' what does it matter if M
5,anger,anger,de Chalusse should be so angered by my refusal to obey him as to drive me from his house
6,null,null,It will rather be so much the better
7,null,null,Pascal will protect me . '
476 7
 (3, 4),(3, 7),
1,null,null,Mademoiselle Marguerite 's weakness vanished
2,null,null,She sprang from her chair
3,anger,indignantly,and indignantly faced the magistrate
4,null,anger,"  It is false
5,null,null,"   she cried
6,null,null,vehemently
7,null,anger,"  and what that paper says is false as well
477 11
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,and her faith imparted an almost sublime expression to her face
2,null,null,"  If I was overcome
3,null,null,monsieur
4,null,null,"   she continued
5,surprise,surprise,"  it was only because I was appalled by the audacity of the accusation
6,null,null,How was it possible to make Pascal even SEEM to be guilty of a dishonorable act
7,null,null,This is beyond my powers of comprehension
8,null,null,I am only certain of one thing that he is innocent
9,null,null,If the whole world rose to testify against him
10,null,null,it would not shake my faith in him
11,null,null,and even if he confessed that he was guilty I should be more likely to believe that he was crazed than culpable
478 14
 (5, 4),
1,null,null,She spoke these words with a sort of satisfaction
2,null,null,expecting that the marquis would betray his disappointed covetousness by some significant gesture or exclamation
3,null,null,and she was already prepared to rejoice at his confusion
4,null,sadness,But her expectations were not realized
5,sadness,slightest dismay or even regret,Instead of evincing the slightest dismay or even regret
6,null,null,de Valorsay drew a long breath
7,null,null,as if a great burden had been lifted from his heart
8,null,null,and his eyes sparkled with apparent delight
9,null,null,"  Then I may venture to speak
10,null,null,"   he exclaimed
11,null,null,with unconcealed satisfaction
12,null,null,"  I will speak
13,null,null,mademoiselle
14,null,null,if you will deign to allow me .  "
480 5
 (1, 5),

2,null,null,"  You are mistaken
3,null,null,General
4,null,null,the count left no will
5,null,sadness,and has made no provision whatever for me .  "
483 13
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,So saying he closed the door again
2,sadness,sadness,and Marguerite was so overwhelmed by this last and unexpected misfortune
3,null,null,that she could hardly stagger back to the vehicle
4,null,null,"  Gone
5,null,null,"   she murmured
6,null,null,"  gone
7,null,null,without a thought of me
8,null,null,Or does he believe me to be like all the rest
9,null,null,But I will find him again
10,null,null,That man Fortunat
11,null,null,who ascertained addresses for M
12,null,null,de Chalusse
13,null,null,will find Pascal for me .  "
484 4
 (1, 1),
1,sadness,sadness,Fortunat took compassion on the man 's embarrassment
2,null,null,"  In short
3,null,null,"   he interrupted
4,null,null,"  you wish to conceal a part of your capital from your creditors

16,null,null,And whenever a gamin
17,null,null,such as I was once
18,null,null,opened the door for ME
19,null,null,I should put a five franc piece in his hand   "
487 19
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,But M
2,null,null,Fortunat had resolved to listen to nothing
3,null,null,He wished for no explanations
4,fear,fear,so distrustful was he of himself so much did he fear that his adventurous nature would urge him to incur further risk
5,null,null,He was positively afraid of the Marquis de Valorsay 's eloquence
6,null,null,besides
7,null,null,he knew well enough that the person who consents to listen is at least half convinced
8,null,null,"  Tell me nothing
9,null,null,monsieur
10,null,null,"   he hastily answered
11,null,null,"  it would be useless
12,null,null,I have n't the money
13,null,null,If I had given you ten thousand francs last night
14,null,null,I should have been compelled to borrow them of M
15,null,null,Prosper Bertomy

488 8
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Victory perched upon the agent 's banner
2,happiness,happiness,and it was with a feeling of pride that he saw his noble client depart
3,null,null,white and speechless with rage
4,null,null,"  What a rascal that marquis is
5,null,null,"   he muttered
6,null,null,"  I would certainly warn Mademoiselle Marguerite
7,null,null,poor girl
8,null,null,if I were not so much afraid of him .  "
489 9
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,As he received high wages
2,null,null,he served passably well
3,null,null,but he employed the best part of his energy in watching the count
4,null,null,He scented some great family secret in the household
5,anger,anger,and he felt angry and humiliated that this secret had not been entrusted to his discretion
6,null,null,And if he had discovered nothing
7,null,null,it was because M
8,null,null,de Chalusse had been caution personified
9,null,null,as Madame Leon had declared .
490 18
 (8, 9),
1,null,null,With total disregard of prudence
2,null,null,he talked with inexcusable freedom of the Count de Chalusse
3,null,null,and M
4,null,null,de Valorsay
5,null,null,and especially of his enemy
6,null,null,Mademoiselle Marguerite
7,null,null,"  For it is she
8,anger,exclaimed,"   he exclaimed
9,null,anger,rapping on the table with his knife  "  it is she who has taken the missing millions
10,null,null,How she did it
11,null,null,no one will ever know
12,null,null,for she has not an equal in craftiness

491 23
 (20, 20),
1,null,null,Once more the valet paused in his perusal of the letter to remark :   "  There it is again sufficient to live upon

22,null,null,so far
23,null,null,asked of you on my bended knees and with clasped hands

 (11, 11),
1,null,null,Having finished the letter
2,null,null,Casimir laid it on the table
3,null,null,and poured out a glass full of brandy
