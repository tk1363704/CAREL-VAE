1,4,4,Powell worried that her husband would again cancel
2,6,6,so she was thrilled when the whole family took off in early July for Kona Village
3,6,6,Hawaii
4,6,6,which was the first leg of the trip .
114 8
 (4, 4),
1,6,6,On the 17th
2,6,6,after the anchor was cast
3,6,6,without a moment 's delay I went off to the British Consulate to see my old friend Colonel Rigby

7,6,6,but Nick was before her .

 (4, 4),
1,6,6,No

3,6,6,Then I realized suddenly what I had failed to grasp before
4,4,4,she 4ed that I would pity her .
211 7
 (5, 1),
1,6,3,Presently the sobs ceased
2,6,6,and Mrs
3,6,6,Temple raised her face
4,6,6,slowly
5,3,6,wondering ly
6,6,6,as if she had not heard aright
7,6,6,And she tried gently to push the girl away .

246 9
 (6, 6),
1,6,6,But the worthy woman had already recovered her self possession and her accustomed loquacity at the same time
2,6,6,"  Ah
3,6,6,my dear young lady
4,6,6,"   she said
5,6,6,bravely
6,1,1,"  im in such sorrow that im losing my senses completely
7,6,6,Still
8,6,6,it was only from the kindest of motives that I ventured into the garden
9,6,6,and I had scarcely entered it before I saw something white run away from me I felt sure it was Mirza and so I ran after it .
263 3
 (1, 1),
1,0,0,What 0 they felt on the day when they purchased that large arm chair
2,6,6,How many times they had gone to admire those velvet curtains in the shop windows before buying them

277 6
 (2, 3),
1,6,6,She never took me with her on these journeys
2,1,eyes would be red,but nearly always when she came back at nightfall her eyes would be red
3,6,1,and I knew the two women had been weeping together
4,6,6,There came a certain hot Sunday in July when she went on this errand
5,6,6,and Grandpa Ripley having gone to spend the day at old man Winn 's
6,6,6,I was left alone .

 (4, 1),
1,6,1,"  But they will not taste a bit like yours
2,6,6,im sure
3,6,6,"   cried Margaret
4,1,despair,in despair .
321 2
 (1, 1),
1,3,3,For she had a new and remarkable beauty which puzzled and astonished me
2,6,6,a beauty in which maternity had no place .

4,0,was tired of,but he was tired of it
5,6,6,and felt that he would be much more comfortable with Mrs
6,6,6,Forbush
7,6,6,So he was ready to make the small pecuniary sacrifice needful .
332 6
 (6, 6),
1,6,6,"  Yes
2,6,6,he has grown
3,6,6,"   said the widow briefly
4,6,6,She hoped that Mr

3,6,6,wondering how it would all end
4,6,6,It ended suddenly
5,6,6,The girl sprang from her knees
6,6,4,as if a gleam of hope had darted through her heart
7,6,6,"  A physician
8,6,6,"   she said
9,4,eagerly,eagerly .
420 9
 (2, 5),
1,6,6,Such was not at all the opinion of the majority of the guests
2,5,6,Four or five of the ladies took flight at the bare suggestion and several men the most aristocratic of the company became angry at once
3,6,6,"  Are you mad
4,6,6,"   said one of them
5,6,5,"  Do you want to see us all summoned as witnesses
6,6,6,You have probably forgotten that Garcia affair
7,6,6,and that rumpus at Jenny Fancy 's house
8,6,6,A fine thing it would be to see
9,6,6,no one knows how many great names mixed up with those of sharper s and notorious women

 (9, 9),

4,6,6,murmuring :   "  Oh
5,6,6,thanks
6,6,6,monsieur
7,6,6,thanks
8,6,6,"   For she was thinking of Pascal
9,4,4,and she had 4ed he might shrink from her when she fully revealed to him her wretched

11,6,6,of which he was entirely ignorant

497 6
 (3, 5),(3, 6),
1,6,6,One afternoon
2,6,6,when Bruno came home from school
3,3,3d,he was 3d to find Maria
4,6,6,the family 's maid who always kept her head bowed and never looked up from the carpet standing in his bedroom
5,6,3,pulling all his belongings out of the wardrobe and packing them in four large wooden crates
6,6,3,even the things he 'd hidden at the back that belonged to him and were nobody else 's business .
498 5
 (3, 3),
1,6,6,' what are you doing
2,6,6,' he asked in as polite a tone as he could muster
3,1,1,for although he wasnt happy to come home and find someone going through his possessions
4,6,6,his mother had always told him that he was to treat Maria respectfully and not just imitate the Way Father spoke to her
5,6,6,' you take your hands off my things . '
499 7
 (5, 4),
1,6,6,Mother had walked into her own bedroom by then but Lars
2,6,6,the butler
3,6,6,was in there
4,6,1,packing her things too
5,1,sighed,She sighed and threw her hands in the air in frustration before marching back to the staircase
6,6,6,followed by Bruno
7,6,6,who wasnt going to let the matter drop without an explanation .
500 3
 (3, 3),
1,6,6,Bruno ran downstairs and even passed her out on the staircase so that he was waiting in the dining room when she arrived
2,6,6,He looked at her without saying anything for a moment and thought to himself that she could n't have applied her make-up correctly that morning because the rims of her eyes were more red than usual
3,1,1,like his own after he 'd been causing chaos and got into trouble and ended up crying .
501 14
 (12, 3),(12, 8),(12, 9),(12, 10),(12, 11),
1,6,6,' what is
2,6,6,' he asked
3,6,1,' am I being sent away
4,6,6,'	' no
5,6,6,not just you
6,6,6,' she said
7,6,6,looking as if she might smile for a moment but thinking better of it
8,6,1,We all are
9,6,1,Your father and I
10,6,1,Gretel and you
11,6,1,All four of us
12,1,frowned,Bruno thought about this and frowned
13,6,6,He wasnt particularly bothered if Gretel was being sent away because she was a Hopeless Case and caused nothing but trouble for him
14,6,6,But it seemed a little unfair that they all had to go with her .

1,0,0,He wasnt particularly bothered if Gretel was being sent away because she was a Hopeless Case and caused nothing but trouble for him
2,6,6,But it seemed a little unfair that they all had to go with her .
503 10
 (9, 9),
1,6,6,' and we all have to go too
2,6,6,' asked Bruno
3,6,6,Of course we do
4,6,6,' said Mother
5,6,6,' you would n't want Father to go to his new job on his own and be lonely there
6,6,6,would you
7,6,6,'	' i suppose not
8,6,6,' said Bruno
9,1,1,Father would miss us all terribly if we were n't with him
10,6,6,' she added .
504 5
 (1, 1),
1,1,1,Mother sighed and looked around the room as if she might never see it again
2,6,6,It was a very beautiful house and had five floors in total
3,6,6,if you included the basement
4,6,6,where Cook  made all the food and Maria and Lars sat at the table arguing with each other and calling each other names that you were n't supposed to use
5,6,6,And if you added in the little room at the top of the house with the slanted windows where Bruno could see right across Berlin if he stood up on his tiptoes and held onto the frame tightly .
505 9
 (3, 7),(3, 8),
1,6,6,' oh my
2,6,6,' said Mother with a laugh
3,1,didnt look happy,although it was a strange kind of laugh because she didnt look happy and turned away from Bruno as if she didnt want him to see her face
4,6,6,' yes
5,6,6,Bruno
6,6,6,' she said
7,6,1,' it 's more than a mile away
8,6,1,Quite a lot more than that
9,6,6,in fact . '
506 8
 (2, 3),
1,6,6,Bruno 's eyes opened wide and his mouth  made the shape of an O
2,3,3d,He felt his arms stretching out at his sides like they did whenever something 3d him
3,6,3,' you dont mean we 're leaving Berlin
4,6,6,' he asked
5,6,6,gasping for air as he got the words out
6,6,6,' im afraid so
7,6,6,' said Mother
8,6,6,nodding her head sadly .

3,3,3,staring at her in 3
4,6,6,' say goodbye to them

6,6,6,spluttering out the words as if his mouth was full of biscuits that he 'd munched into tiny pieces but not actually swallowed yet

8,6,6,' he continued
9,6,6,his voice coming d5ously close to shouting

511 5
 (1, 4),
1,1,sorry,' im sorry
2,6,6,Bruno
3,6,6,' said Mother
4,6,1,' but your plans are just going to have to wait
5,6,6,We dont have a choice in this . '
512 6
 (6, 6),
1,6,6,' bruno
2,6,6,that 's enough
3,6,6,' she said
4,6,6,snapping at him now and standing up to show him that she was serious when she said that was enough
5,6,6,' honestly
6,1,1,only last week you were complaining about how much things have changed here recently . '
513 11
 (10, 7),
1,6,6,' everyone has to do that
2,6,6,' said Mother
3,6,6,' it keeps us safe
4,6,6,And who knows
5,6,6,maybe we 'll be in less d5 if we move away
6,6,6,Now
7,6,1,I need you to go upstairs and help Maria with your packing
8,6,6,We dont have as much time to prepare as I would have liked
9,6,6,thanks to some people
10,1,sadly,Bruno nodded and walked away sadly
11,6,6,knowing that  ' some people ' was a grown-up 's word for ' father ' and one that he wasnt supposed to use himself .
514 3
 (2, 1),
1,6,3,When he first saw their new house Bruno 's eyes opened wide
2,3,his mouth  made the shape of an O,his mouth  made the shape of an O and his arms stretched out at his sides once again
3,6,6,Everything about it seemed to be the exact opposite of their old home and he could n't believe that they were really going to live there .
515 2
 (1, 2),
1,1,no one ever laughed,But there was something about the new house that  made Bruno think that no one ever laughed there
2,6,1,that there was nothing to laugh at and nothing to be happy about .
516 3
 (2, 2),
1,6,6,Bruno had a pain in his stomach and he could feel something growing inside him
2,5,5,something that when it worked its way up from the lowest depths inside him to the outside world would either make him shout and scream that the whole thing was wrong and unfair and a big mistake for which somebody would pay one of these days
3,6,6,or just make him burst into tears instead .

 (5, 2),
1,6,6,' bruno
2,6,1,I want you to go upstairs and unpack and I want you to do it now
3,6,6,' said Mother in an unfriendly voice
4,6,6,and he knew that she meant business so he turned round and marched away without another word
5,1,tears,He could feel tears springing up behind his eyes but he was determined that he would n't allow them to appear .
520 8
 (2, 5),
1,6,6,Just at that moment there was a creak outside in the hallway and Bruno looked up to see the door of Mother and Father 's room opening slightly
2,4,froze,He froze
3,6,6,unable to move for a moment
4,6,6,Mother was still downstairs
5,6,4,which meant that Father was in there and he might have heard everything that Bruno had just said
6,6,6,He watched the door
7,6,6,hardly daring to breathe
8,6,6,wondering whether Father might come through it and take him downstairs for a serious talking to .
521 9
 (7, 7),
1,6,6,' one
2,6,6,of your father 's soldiers
3,6,6,I suppose
4,6,6,' said Maria
5,6,6,who had stood up very straight when the young man appeared and held her hands before her like a person in prayer
6,6,6,She had stared down at the ground rather than at his face
7,4,4,as if she was afraid she might be turned to stone if she looked directly at him
8,6,6,she only relaxed when he had gone
9,6,6,' we 'll get to know them in time . '
522 5
 (2, 1),
1,6,1,' i dont see what else there is to do other than that
2,1,sadly,' said Bruno sadly
3,6,6,' i dont even think there 's going to be anyone to play with other than Gretel

5,6,6,She 's a Hopeless Case . '

7,6,6,not wanting to look like a baby in front of Maria
8,6,6,He looked around the room without fully lifting his eyes up from the ground
9,6,6,trying to see whether there was anything of interest to be found .
524 5
 (3, 1),
1,6,5,He ran into Gretel 's room without knocking and discovered her placing her civilization of dolls on various shelves around the room
2,6,6,' what are you doing in here
3,5,shouted,' she shouted
4,6,6,spinning round
5,6,6,dont you know you dont enter a lady 's room without knocking
525 9
 (8, 5),
1,6,6,' of course I did
2,6,6,' she replied
3,6,6,' you dont think i 'd have left them at home
4,6,6,Why
5,6,1,it could be weeks before we 're back there again
6,6,6,' weeks
7,6,6,' said Bruno
8,1,disappointed,sounding disappointed but secretly pleased because he 'd resigned himself to the idea of spending a month there
9,6,6,' do you really think so
526 9
 (8, 5),
1,6,6,' of course I did

527 5
 (4, 4),
1,6,6,' of course
2,6,6,' said Gretel
3,6,6,who always spoke of Father as if he could never do any wrong and never got angry and always came in to kiss her goodnight before she went to sleep which
4,1,1,if Bruno was to be really fair and not just sad about moving houses
5,6,6,he would have admitted Father did for him too .
528 6
 (6, 4),
1,6,6,' and I miss Hilda and Isobel and Louise
2,6,6,' said Gretel
3,6,6,and Bruno tried to remember which of those three girls was the monster
4,6,5,' i dont think the other children look at all friendly
5,6,6,' said Bruno
6,5,stare at him,and Gretel immediately stopped putting one of her more terrifying dolls on a shelf and turned round to stare at him .
530 11
 (5, 5),
1,6,6,' look over there
2,6,6,' said Bruno
3,6,6,and Gretel followed the direction of the finger he was pointing and saw
4,6,6,emerging from a hut in the distance
5,4,4,a group of children huddled together and being shouted at by a group of soldiers
6,6,6,The more they were shouted at
7,6,6,the closer they huddled together

5,6,3,' you 're not a doctor
6,6,6,Pavel stopped peeling the carrots for a moment and looked across the table at Bruno
7,6,6,his head held low
8,6,6,his eyes looking up
9,6,6,as if he were wondering what to say to such a thing
10,6,6,He sighed and seemed to consider it for quite a long time before saying
11,6,3,' yes I am
12,3,3,Bruno stared at him in 3
13,6,6,This didnt make any sense to him

592 8
 (7, 6),
1,6,6,dont argue with me go to your room

3,6,6,and Bruno stepped off the chair
4,6,6,putting his weight on what he had decided to call his bad leg
5,6,6,and it hurt a little
6,6,0,He turned and left the room but was still able to hear Mother saying thank you to Pavel as he walked towards the stairs
7,0,happy,and this  made Bruno happy because surely it was obvious to everyone that if it had not been for him
8,6,6,he would have bled to death .

 (7, 5),(7, 6),(7, 7),
1,6,6,Grandfather had spent his entire life running a restaurant in the centre of town
2,6,6,and one of his employees was the father of Bruno 's friend Martin who worked there as a chef
3,6,6,Although Grandfather no longer cooked or waited on tables in the restaurant himself
4,6,6,he spent most of his days there
5,6,0,sitting at the bar in the afternoon talking to the customers
6,6,0,eating his meals there in the evening and staying until closing time
7,0,0,laughing with his friends .
594 3
 (1, 1),

4,6,6,It really was something special
5,6,6,Compared to the other soldiers who came in and out of the house
6,6,6,he stood out
7,6,6,and they seemed to respect him all the more now that he had it
8,6,6,Mother went up to him and kissed him on the cheek and ran a hand across the front of it
9,6,6,commenting on how fine she thought the fabric was
10,6,6,Bruno was particularly impressed by all the decorations on the uniform and he had been allowed to wear the cap for a short period
11,6,6,provided his hands were clean when he put it on .

602 9
 (7, 7),
1,6,6,The walk along the fence took Bruno a lot longer than he expected
2,6,6,it seemed to stretch on and on for several miles
3,6,6,He walked and walked
4,6,6,and when he looked back the house that he was living in became smaller and smaller until it vanished from sight altogether
5,6,6,During all this time he never saw anyone anywhere close to the fence
6,6,6,nor did he find any doors to let him inside
7,1,1,and he started to despair that his exploration was going to be entirely unsuccessful
8,6,6,In fact although the fence continued as far as the eye could see
9,6,6,the huts and buildings and smoke stacks were disappearing in the distance behind him and the fence seemed to be separating him from nothing but open space .
603 6
 (2, 2),
1,6,6,He stared at the boy and considered asking him why he looked so sad but hesitated because he thought it might sound rude
2,4,4,He knew that sometimes people who were sad didnt want to be asked about it
3,6,6,sometimes they 'd offer the information themselves and sometimes they would n't stop talking about it for months on end
4,6,6,but on this occasion Bruno thought that he should wait before saying anything
5,6,6,He had discovered something during his exploration
6,6,6,and now that he was finally talking to one of the people on the other side of the fence it seemed like a good idea to make the most of the opportunity .
604 9
 (6, 5),
1,6,6,Shmuel thought about it and looked down at his fingers and they wiggled in the air
2,6,6,as if he was trying to calculate

5,6,3,' my birthday is April the fifteenth nineteen thirty-four

6,6,6,' no

3,6,6,cocking his head a little to the side as he waited for an answer

6,6,6,' well
7,6,6,sort of

9,6,6,He had hoped that Shmuel might have said no as it would give them something else in common

1,6,3,' the Fury has something he wants to discuss with me

608 11
 (6, 6),
1,6,6,An hour before the Fury was due to arrive Gretel and Bruno were brought downstairs
2,6,6,where they received a rare invitation into Father 's office
3,6,6,Gretel was wearing a white dress and knee socks and her hair had been twisted into corkscrew curls
4,6,6,Bruno was wearing a pair of dark brown shorts
5,6,6,a plain white shirt and a dark brown tie
6,0,0,He had a new pair of shoes for the occasion and was very proud of them
7,6,6,even though they were too small for him and were pinching his feet and making it difficult for him to walk
8,6,6,All these preparations and fine clothes seemed a little extravagant
9,6,6,all the same
10,6,6,because Bruno and Gretel were n't even invited to dinner
11,6,6,they had eaten an hour earlier .
609 6
 (6, 5),
1,6,6,The woman standing beside him
2,6,6,however
3,6,6,was quite the most beautiful woman he had ever seen in his life
4,6,6,She had blonde hair and very red lips
5,6,4,and while the Fury spoke to Mother she turned and looked at Bruno and smiled
6,4,embarrassment,making him go red with embarrassment .
610 8
 (7, 3),(7, 5),(7, 6),
1,6,6,The matter was resolved quickly
2,6,6,however
3,6,4,as the Fury
4,6,6,who was the rudest guest Bruno had ever witnessed
5,6,4,turned round and walked directly into the dining room and promptly sat down at the head of the table in Father 's seat
6,6,4,without another word
7,4,flustered,A little flustered

4,1,sad,but for some reason he had not really understood at the time how sad that must have  made his friend

3,6,6,He took a knife from the drawer and cut himself a few healthy slices and coated them with the stuffing before turning back to his friend .
643 8
 (3, 7),
1,6,6,Shmuel looked as if he wasnt really listening
2,6,6,instead his eyes were focused on the slices of chicken and stuffing that Bruno was throwing casually into his mouth

7,0,0,The boy stared at the food in his hand for a moment and then looked up at Bruno with wide and grateful but terrified eyes
8,6,6,He threw one more glance in the direction of the door and then seemed to make a decision
9,6,6,because he thrust all three slices into his mouth in one go and gobbled them down in twenty seconds flat .

 (10, 1),
1,6,5,' you have been eating

3,6,6,' did you steal something from that fridge

3,6,1,He had never felt so ashamed in his life
4,6,1,he had never imagined that he could behave so cruelly
5,6,6,He wondered how a boy who thought he was a good person really could act in such a cowardly way towards a friend
6,6,6,He sat in the living room for several hours but could n't concentrate on his book and didnt dare to go back to the kitchen until later that evening
7,6,6,when Lieutenant Kotler had already come back and collected Shmuel and taken him away again .

652 3
 (3, 3),
1,6,6,Bruno had not seen his grandmother since leaving Berlin but he had thought about her every day
2,6,6,The things he remembered most about her were the productions that she and he and Gretel performed at Christmas and birthdays and how she always had the perfect costume to suit whatever role he played
3,1,1,When he thought that they would never be able to do that again it  made him very sad indeed .
653 8
 (6, 8),
1,6,6,The two days they spent in Berlin were also very sad ones
2,6,6,There was the funeral
3,6,6,and Bruno and Gretel and Father and Mother and Grandfather sat in the front row
4,6,6,Father wearing his most impressive uniform
5,6,6,the starched and pressed one with the decorations
6,1,sad,Father was particularly sad
7,6,6,Mother told Bruno
8,6,1,because he had fought with Grandmother and they had not  made it up before she died .
655 7
 (7, 7),
1,6,6,There was also the fact that Lieutenant Kotler had been transferred away from out with and wasnt around to make Bruno feel angry and upset all the time
2,6,6,( His departure had come about very suddenly and there had been a lot of shouting between Father and Mother about it late at night
3,6,6,but he was gone
4,6,6,that was for sure
5,6,6,and he wasnt coming back
6,6,6,Gretel was inconsolable
7,0,0,That was something else to be happy about :  no one called him ' little man ' any more .
657 6
 (5, 3),(5, 4),
1,6,6,' no
2,6,6,' said Bruno
3,6,0,' i dont understand why we 're not allowed on the other side of it
4,6,0,What 's so wrong with us that we cant go over there and play
5,0,laughing,' Gretel stared at him and then suddenly started laughing
6,6,6,only stopping when she saw that Bruno was being perfectly serious .
658 10
 (9, 9),
1,6,6,' we 're the opposite
2,6,6,' said Gretel
3,6,6,answering quickly and sounding a lot more satisfied with this answer
4,6,6,' yes
5,6,6,that 's it
6,6,6,we 're the opposite
7,6,6,' all right
8,6,6,' said Bruno
9,0,0,pleased that he had it settled in his head at last
10,6,6,' and the Opposite live on this side of the fence and the Jews live on that . '

 (6, 8),(6, 9),
1,6,6,' no
2,6,6,Bruno
3,6,6,' said Gretel
4,6,6,but she said this slowly because she had discovered something unusual in her hair and was examining it carefully
5,6,6,' well
6,3,scream,cant someone just get them together and ' bruno was interrupted by the sound of Gretel breaking into a piercing scream
7,6,6,one that woke Mother up from her afternoon nap and brought her running into the bedroom to find out which of her children had murdered the other one
8,6,3,While experimenting with her hair Gretel had found a tiny egg
9,6,3,no bigger than the top of a pin .
660 3
 (3, 1),
1,6,1,It turned out that both Gretel and Bruno had lice in their hair
2,6,6,and Gretel had to be treated with a special shampoo that smelled horrible and afterwards she sat in her room for hours on end
3,1,crying,crying her eyes out .
661 5
 (3, 2),
1,6,6,Bruno had the shampoo as well
2,6,1,but then Father decided that the best thing was for him to start afresh and he got a razor and shaved all Bruno 's hair off
3,1,cry,which  made Bruno cry
4,6,6,It didnt take long and he hated seeing all his hair float down from his head and land on the floor at his feet
5,6,6,but Father said it had to be done .

4,2,2,It didnt take long and he hated seeing all his hair float down from his head and land on the floor at his feet
5,6,6,but Father said it had to be done .
663 3
 (1, 2),
1,1,sick,Afterwards Bruno looked at himself in the bathroom mirror and he felt sick
2,6,1,His entire head looked misshapen now that he was bald and his eyes looked too big for his face
3,6,6,He was almost scared of his own reflection .
664 5
 (4, 1),
1,6,1,When he saw his friend the next day Shmuel started to laugh at Bruno 's appearance
2,6,6,which didnt do a lot for his dwindling self-confidence
3,6,6,' i look just like you now
4,1,sadly,' said Bruno sadly
5,6,6,as if this was a terrible thing to admit .
665 10
 (1, 9),(1, 10),
1,0,unhappy,Over the course of the next few weeks Mother seemed increasingly unhappy with life at out with and Bruno understood perfectly well why that might be
2,6,6,After all
3,6,6,when they 'd first arrived he had hated it
4,6,6,due to the fact that it was nothing like home and lacked such things as three best friends for life
5,6,6,But that had changed for him over time
6,6,6,mostly due to Shmuel
7,6,6,who had become more important to him than Karl or Daniel or Martin had ever been
8,6,6,But Mother didnt have a Shmuel of her own
9,6,0,There was no one for her to talk to
10,6,0,and the only person who she had been remotely friendly with the young Lieutenant Kotler had been transferred somewhere else .
666 3
 (3, 3),
1,6,6,But on the other hand he 'd grown used to life at out with :  he didnt mind Herr Liszt
2,6,6,he 'd become much friendlier with Maria than he ever had been back in Berlin
3,0,0,Gretel was still going through a phase and keeping out of his way ( and she didnt seem to be quite so much of a Hopeless Case any more ) and his afternoon conversations with Shmuel filled him with 0 .
667 8
 (6, 6),
1,6,6,Nothing at all changed for a few weeks
2,6,6,life went on as normal
3,6,6,Father spent most of his time either in his office or on the other side of the fence
4,6,6,Mother kept very quiet during the day and was having an awful lot more of her afternoon naps
5,6,6,some of them not even in the afternoon but before lunch
6,4,4,and Bruno was worried for her health because he 'd never known anyone need quite so many medicinal sherries
7,6,6,Gretel stayed in her room concentrating on the various maps she had pasted on the walls and consulting the newspapers for hours at a time before moving the pins around a little
8,6,6,( Herr Liszt was particularly pleased with her for doing this .  )
668 2
 (1, 1),
1,0,0,And Bruno did exactly what was asked of him and caused no chaos at all and enjoyed the fact that he had one secret friend whom no one knew about
2,6,6,Then one day Father summoned Bruno and Gretel into his office and informed them of the changes that were to come .
669 4
 (2, 3),
1,6,6,Miss Smith 's further confidences were interrupted by the aunts and behind them
2,3,3,to Maggie 's great 3
3,6,3,Mr Warlock and his son
4,6,6,The sudden descent of these gentlemen upon the still lingering echoes of Miss Caroline Smith 's critical and explanatory remarks embarrassed Maggie .
670 7
 (4, 4),
1,6,6,I like going into London churches by chance
2,6,6,there 's always something interesting
3,6,6,something you would n't expect
4,3,3,The Chapel simply astonished me
5,6,6,I could n't imagine what they were all about
6,6,6,it wasnt the ordinary London congregation
7,6,6,it was almost the ordinary London service and yet not quite
671 7
 (1, 1),
1,4,4,But it was Mr Warlock 's reality of which she was afraid
2,6,6,As he continued his prayer she felt all her old terror return
3,6,6,that terror that she had known on the night her father died
4,6,6,during the hours that she had watched beside his dead body
5,6,6,at the moment when she had first arrived at the house in London
6,6,6,during her first visit to the Chapel
7,6,6,when she had said good night to her aunt before going out with Uncle Mathew
672 5
 (4, 4),(4, 5),
1,6,6,"  On the contrary
2,6,6,"   she answered

 (3, 3),
1,6,6,My Lord called me into the great cabin below
2,6,6,where he told me that the Presbyterians are quite mastered by the Cavaliers
3,4,4,and that he 4s Mr Crewe did go a little too far the other day in keeping out the young lords from a sitting
4,6,6,That he do expect that the King should be brought over suddenly
5,6,6,without staying to make any terms at all
6,6,6,saying that the Presbyterians did intend to have brought him in with such conditions as if he had been in chains .
686 5
 (1, 2),
1,1,my heart was quite pulled down,In the afternoon my heart was quite pulled down
2,6,1,by being told that Mr Barlow was to enquire to-day for Mr Coventry
3,6,6,but at night I met with my Lord
4,6,6,who told me that I need not 4
5,6,6,for he would get me the place against the world .

1,6,6,Sir H

5,6,6,always running to others for advice and perplexed to a frenzy by the choices of life "  What shall I do
6,6,6,"   is his prime question
7,4,4,largely because he 4s to commit himself to any line of action . Once a man chooses
8,6,6,he shuts a great many doors of opportunity and gambles with Fate that he has chosen right

 (4, 4),
1,6,6,I ate mine
2,6,6,as was natural
3,6,6,with a spoon

5,6,6,instead of doing the same
6,6,6,drew from her pocket a little case
7,6,6,from which she selected a long pin
8,6,6,and by the help of this pin conveyed her rice grain by grain to her mouth .

12,6,6,She could see that he was looking on her affairs quite as if they were his own
13,6,6,trying to make them safe and secure .
862 4
 (3, 3),
1,6,6,Anne the kitchen maid scoured the pans
2,6,6,her bony frame seemed to rattle as she scrubbed with her red hands
3,0,0,she was happy because she was hungry and there would be a beef steak pudding for dinner
4,6,6,She sang to herself as she worked .
867 3
 (2, 2),
1,6,6,She did not pretend to care for her father
2,1,1,she was very lonely because the villagers hated him
3,6,6,but she had always made the best of everything because she had never had an intimate friend to tell her that that was a foolish thing to do .
868 7
 (2, 2),(2, 3),
1,6,6,She could not pretend that she was sorry that her father had died
2,1,1,and yet she missed him because she knew very well that she was now no one 's business
3,6,1,that she was utterly and absolutely alone in the universe
4,6,6,It might be said that she could not be utterly alone when she had her Uncle Mathew
5,6,6,but
6,6,6,although she was ignorant of life
7,6,6,she knew her Uncle Mathew
869 7
 (6, 6),
1,6,6,He was rather pathetic
2,6,6,having drunk nothing out of respect to the occasion
3,6,6,he felt
4,6,6,somewhere deep down in him
5,6,6,a persistent exaltation that his brother Charles was dead
6,1,1,but he knew that it was not decent to allow this feeling to conquer him and he was truly anxious to protect and comfort his niece so well as he was able
7,6,6,Early in the afternoon he suggested that they should go for a walk .
872 11
 (11, 3),(11, 4),(11, 5),(11, 6),
1,6,6,She would have loved him had he allowed her
2,6,6,and because he did not she bore him no grudge
3,6,0,She had always regarded her life
4,6,0,sterile and unprofitable as it was
5,6,0,with humour until now when
6,6,0,like a discarded dress
7,6,6,it had slipped behind her
8,6,6,She did not see it
9,6,6,even now
10,6,6,with bitterness
11,0,there was no bitterness,there was no bitterness for anything in her character .
873 4
 (1, 3),
1,1,wont be happy,"  You wont be happy there
2,6,6,my dear
3,6,1,with all their religion and the rest of it and two old maids
4,6,6,youll see no life at all .  "
874 8
 (5, 3),(5, 4),
1,6,6,He was angry and helpless
2,6,6,She seemed suddenly some one with whom it was impossible to argue
3,6,1,He had intended to be pathetic
4,6,1,to paint delightful pictures of uncle and niece sheltering snugly together defended by their affection against a cold and hostile London
5,1,His own eyes had filled with tears,His own eyes had filled with tears as he thought of it
6,6,6,What a hard
7,6,6,cold-hearted girl she was
8,6,6,Nevertheless for the moment he abandoned the subject .
875 5
 (2, 3),(2, 4),
1,6,6,All this was very fascinating to Maggie who was of a practical mind with regard to the facts immediately before her but had beyond them a lively imagination
2,1,lonely,Her life had been so lonely
3,6,1,spent for the most part so far from children of her own age
4,6,1,that she had no test of reality
5,6,6,She did not see any reason why the Lord God should not come again and she saw every reason why her aunts should condemn her uncle .
876 3
 (1, 1),
1,5,5,Today Maggie 's abrupt checking of his projects had made him sulky and he talked but little
2,6,6,"  Damn it all
3,6,6,"   he had started out with the most charming intentions towards the girl and now look at her
877 10
 (5, 7),
1,6,6,Had she been pretty he might have
2,6,6,even now
3,6,6,forgiven her
4,6,6,but today she looked especially plain with her pale face and shabby black dress and her obstinate mouth and chin
5,1,uneasy,He was uneasy
6,6,6,too
7,6,1,about the imminent arrival of his sister Anne
8,6,6,who always frightened him and made him think poorly of the world in general
9,6,6,No hope of getting any money out of her
10,6,6,nor would Charles have left him a penny .
878 4
 (1, 1),
1,0,0,She felt pleasure in his company
2,6,6,for the first time since her father 's death she was a little frightened and uneasy
3,6,6,She might even have gone to him and cried on his shoulder had he given her any encouragement
4,6,6,but he did not speak to her except to say that he had already eaten .
879 4
 (2, 2),
1,6,6,She felt pleasure in his company
2,4,4,for the first time since her father 's death she was a little frightened and uneasy
3,6,6,She might even have gone to him and cried on his shoulder had he given her any encouragement
4,6,6,but he did not speak to her except to say that he had already eaten .
880 6
 (4, 4),
1,6,6,Her uncle
2,6,6,watching her surreptitiously
3,6,6,wondered of what she was thinking
4,3,3,Her determined treatment of him that afternoon continued to 3 him
5,6,6,She certainly ought to make her way in the world
6,6,6,but what a pity that she was so plain .
882 3
 (1, 1),
1,2,2,She hated that he should call her Miss Maggie
2,6,6,He had always treated her with considerable respect
3,6,6,but to-day she fancied that he patronised her .
883 3
 (1, 1),
1,5,5,Miss Cardinal did not regard him at all and Maggie saw that this annoyed him
2,6,6,The girl watched her aunt
3,6,6,conscious of some strange new excitement at her heart .
884 7
 (4, 4),
1,6,6,Maggie 's eyes lit up
2,6,6,"  It has not
3,6,6,"   she said
4,0,0,"  been very exciting here always
5,6,6,Then she went on
6,6,6,colour in her cheeks
7,6,6,"  I think father did all he could .
885 6
 (2, 5),
1,6,6,Her lips quivered
2,1,was near tears,again she was near tears
3,6,6,and again
4,6,6,as it had been on her walk with Uncle Mathew
5,6,1,her regret was not for her father but for the waste that her life with him had been
6,6,6,But there was something in her aunt that prevented complete confidence .
886 6
 (5, 5),
1,6,6,Her lips quivered
2,6,6,again she was near tears
3,6,6,and again
4,6,6,as it had been on her walk with Uncle Mathew
5,1,1,her regret was not for her father but for the waste that her life with him had been
6,6,6,But there was something in her aunt that prevented complete confidence .
887 6
 (4, 4),
1,6,6,Brother and sister shook hands
2,6,6,and Maggie
3,6,6,as she watched them
4,3,3,was 3d to feel within herself a certain sympathy with her uncle
5,6,6,Aunt Anne 's greeting was gentle and kind but infinitely distant
6,6,6,and had something of the tenderness with which the Pope washes the feet of the beggars in Rome .
888 5
 (1, 2),
1,3,3,Her uncle looked at her with great 3
2,6,3,after his behaviour of last night he had not expected this
3,6,6,Reassured
4,6,6,he began a voluble explanation of his movements and plans
5,6,6,rubbing his hands together and turning one boot against the other .
889 6
 (1, 1),
1,4,4,Her aunt stood at her side and once again Maggie felt irritation at her composure
2,6,6,"  After all
3,6,6,he was her brother
4,6,6,"   she thought
5,6,6,She remembered the feeling and passion with which her aunt had repeated the Twenty-third Psalm
6,6,6,She was puzzled .
891 9
 (3, 3),(3, 4),(3, 5),
1,6,6,Thus her aunt found her
2,6,6,later in the evening
3,0,0,She was touched by the figure
4,6,0,the shabby black frock
5,6,0,the white tired face
6,6,6,She had been honestly disappointed in her niece
7,6,6,disappointed in her plainness
8,6,6,in her apparent want of heart
9,6,6,in her silence and moroseness .
892 9
 (7, 7),
1,6,6,Thus her aunt found her

5,6,6,the white tired face
6,6,6,She had been honestly disappointed in her niece

9,6,6,in her silence and moroseness .
893 9
 (6, 6),
1,6,6,Thus her aunt found her
2,6,6,later in the evening
3,6,6,She was touched by the figure
4,6,6,the shabby black frock
5,6,6,the white tired face
6,1,1,She had been honestly disappointed in her niece
7,6,6,disappointed in her plainness
8,6,6,in her apparent want of heart
9,6,6,in her silence and moroseness .
894 3
 (3, 3),
1,6,6,The rest of the interview came to her only dimly
2,6,6,She knew that Uncle Mathew was still upon his feet protesting
3,3,3,that her aunt 's face was cold and wore a look of distressed 3 as though some one had suddenly been rude to her .
895 5
 (3, 4),
1,6,6,Mathew was uncomfortable now
2,6,6,His mood had changed
3,1,sullen,he was sullen
4,6,1,His sister always made him feel like a disgraced dog
5,6,6,He shuffled on his feet .
899 8
 (3, 2),
1,6,6,"  Oh
2,6,1,it 's bad luck
3,1,cried,"   she cried
4,6,6,staring distress fully at the old man
5,6,6,He smiled
6,6,6,and would have certainly been very agreeable to her had not Aunt Anne
7,6,6,who had been finding their boxes and securing a cab
8,6,6,arrived and taken Maggie away .
900 8
 (4, 2),
1,6,6,"  Oh
2,6,1,it 's bad luck
3,6,6,"   she cried
4,1,distress fully,staring distress fully at the old man
5,6,6,He smiled
6,6,6,and would have certainly been very agreeable to her had not Aunt Anne
7,6,6,who had been finding their boxes and securing a cab
8,6,6,arrived and taken Maggie away .
904 5
 (1, 1),
1,1,1,Maggie fancied that the three persons were nervous of her aunt
2,6,6,the stout young man was amused perhaps at the general situation
3,6,6,but Mr
4,6,6,Magnus by the fireplace showed great emotion
5,6,6,the colour mounting into his high bony cheeks and his nostrils twitching like a horse 's .
905 5
 (2, 2),
1,6,6,Maggie fancied that the three persons were nervous of her aunt
2,0,0,the stout young man was amused perhaps at the general situation
3,6,6,but Mr
4,6,6,Magnus by the fireplace showed great emotion
5,6,6,the colour mounting into his high bony cheeks and his nostrils twitching like a horse 's .
906 6
 (5, 5),
1,6,6,There was no one in the room
2,6,6,she felt
3,6,6,as she lay there
4,6,6,an increasing irritation at her weakness
5,4,4,She was afraid too for her future
6,6,6,Did she faint like this at the earliest opportunity people would allow her no chance of earning her living .
907 6
 (4, 5),
1,6,6,She stared at her aunt
2,6,6,then at a long mirror that faced her bed
3,6,6,then at the lighted sky
4,0,warmly grateful,She felt warmly grateful
5,6,0,eager to show all the world that she would do her best
6,6,6,that she was ready to give herself to this new life with all her soul and strength she could say nothing .
908 13
 (11, 8),(11, 9),
1,6,6,Then
2,6,6,deep down in her soul
3,6,6,she knew that she wanted success
4,6,6,a magnificent life
5,6,6,a great future
6,6,6,Any more
7,6,6,she expected it
8,6,0,She had force and strength
9,6,0,and she would compel life to give her what she wanted
10,6,6,She laughed at herself in the glass
11,0,happy,She was happy
12,6,6,almost triumphant
13,6,6,and for no reason at all .
910 8
 (2, 4),
1,6,6,She hated sentiment and affectation in any one
2,4,afraid,She was afraid
3,6,6,too
4,6,4,that Anne bullied Aunt Elizabeth
5,6,6,Maggie was sorry for Aunt Elizabeth but
6,6,6,with all the arrogance of the young
7,6,6,a little despised her
8,6,6,Why did she tremble and start like that
913 5
 (3, 3),
1,6,6,Aunt Anne walked first and took what was obviously her own regular seat near the front
2,6,6,Maggie sat between her two aunts
3,3,3,She could not feel for the moment anything but a startled 3 at the ugliness of the building
4,6,6,She had entered at different times the Glebeshire chapels
5,6,6,but their primitive position and need had given them the spirit of honest sincerity .
916 4
 (2, 2),
1,6,6,But behind the facility and easy flow of his words Maggie fancied that she detected some urgent insistence that came from the man 's very heart
2,0,0,She was moved by that as though he were saying to her personally
3,6,6,"  dont heed these outward words of mine
4,6,6,But listen to me myself .
917 8
 (4, 5),
1,6,6,"  you 've come to live here
2,6,6,have n't you
3,6,6,"   continued Miss Smith
4,0,glad,"  im so glad
5,6,0,I think you look so nice
6,6,6,You dont mind my saying that
7,6,6,do you
8,6,6,I always tell people what I think of them and then one knows where one is .
918 5
 (5, 5),
1,6,6,Miss Smith 's further confidences were interrupted by the aunts and behind them
2,6,6,to Maggie 's great 3
3,6,6,Mr
4,6,6,Warlock and his son
5,1,1,The sudden descent of these gentlemen upon the still lingering echoes of Miss Caroline Smith 's critical and explanatory remarks embarrassed Maggie .
919 9
 (5, 6),
1,6,6,His voice was of an extreme kindliness and his eyes
2,6,6,when she looked up at him
3,6,6,shone with friendliness
4,6,6,She found herself
5,3,3,to her own 3
6,6,3,talking to him with great ease
7,6,6,He was perfectly simple
8,6,6,human and unaffected
9,6,6,He asked her about her country .
921 3
 (2, 2),
1,6,6,How fantastic these theories of fire and passion must seem
2,0,0,he amused himself by considering
3,6,6,to any one who knew his mother only from the outside .
922 6
 (1, 1),
1,4,4,Her 4 was of Martin
2,6,6,She 4ed very deeply his influence upon her husband
3,6,6,During Martin 's absence she and Amy had managed very successfully to have the house as they wished it
4,6,6,John Warlock
5,6,6,the master
6,6,6,had been too deeply occupied with the affairs of the soul to be concerned also with the affairs of the body .
923 6
 (2, 2),
1,6,6,Her 4 was of Martin
2,4,4,She 4ed very deeply his influence upon her husband
3,6,6,During Martin 's absence she and Amy had managed very successfully to have the house as they wished it
4,6,6,John Warlock
5,6,6,the master
6,6,6,had been too deeply occupied with the affairs of the soul to be concerned also with the affairs of the body .
924 3
 (2, 2),
1,6,6,She had seen before in earlier days the force of her husband 's passion when it was roused
2,4,4,There was something now in his reception of their son that terrified her
3,6,6,She had at once perceived that Amy was as deeply moved as she .
927 5
 (2, 2),
1,6,6,"  I might not have come
2,3,3,"   Martin said with a sudden 5 that 3d himself
3,6,6,"  She made no conditions
4,6,6,I might have gone on with my life there abroad
5,6,6,I am free to lead my own life where and how I please .  "
928 9
 (3, 3),
1,6,6,What did Martin remember
2,6,6,He remembered a good deal
3,3,3,He was 3d when he began to think
4,6,6,"  Did he remember
5,6,6,his father suggested a scene
6,6,6,a day yes
7,6,6,he remembered that
8,6,6,His father continued
9,6,6,as though it had been for his own pleasure .
933 3
 (2, 2),
1,6,6,Her attitude was one of 3d excitement
2,3,3,She was amazed by the most ordinary incidents and conversations
3,6,6,She found Maggie 's life quite incredible .
934 12
 (9, 8),
1,6,6,She had been trained in another school from Caroline
2,6,6,she felt from the very first that upon certain questions her lovely friend was inexperienced
3,6,6,foolish and d5ously reckless
4,6,6,On the question of  "  men
5,6,6,"   for instance
6,6,6,Maggie
7,6,6,with clear knowledge of her father and her uncle
8,6,1,refused to follow Caroline 's light and easy excursions
9,1,disappointed,Caroline was disappointed
10,6,6,she had a great deal to say on the subject and could speak
11,6,6,she assured Maggie
12,6,6,from a vast variety of experience :   "  Men are all the same .
935 5
 (2, 2),
1,6,6,Maggie soon discovered that Mr
2,0,0,Magnus was very happy to sit in their house even though Aunt Anne was not present
3,6,6,His attitude seemed to be that the atmosphere that she left behind her was enough for him and that he could not
4,6,6,in justice
5,6,6,expect any more .
938 5
 (3, 3),
1,6,6,The young man was apparently in love with a lady much older than himself
2,6,6,who wore pince-nez
3,3,3,but it was an arid kind of love in which the young man discovered motives and symptoms with the same dexterous 3 with which he discovered newts and tadpoles in the cellar pond
4,6,6,Maggie bravely attacked Mr
5,6,6,Magnus .
940 7
 (2, 5),
1,6,6,This was beyond Maggie altogether
2,0,agreeable,An agreeable thing
3,6,6,however
4,6,6,about Mr
5,6,0,Magnus was that he did not mind when you disliked his work
6,6,6,He seemed to expect that you would not like it
7,6,6,He was certainly a very un conceited man .
941 7
 (4, 4),
1,6,6,I could n't imagine what they were all about
2,6,6,it wasnt the ordinary London congregation
3,6,6,it was almost the ordinary London service and yet not quite
4,0,0,there was an air of expectation and even excitement which is most unusual in a London church
5,6,6,Then there was Warlock
6,6,6,Of course one could see at once that he was an extraordinary man
7,6,6,a kind of prophet all on his own
943 7
 (4, 4),
1,6,6,What was there then in Maggie that started up in rebellion at this unexpected declaration
2,6,6,She had been sitting there
3,6,6,tranquil
4,0,0,soothed with a happy sense that her new life was developing securely for her in the way that she would have it
5,6,6,Suddenly she was alert
6,6,6,suspicious
7,6,6,hostile .
944 8
 (7, 7),
1,6,6,"  Said
2,6,6,"   he repeated
3,6,6,stammering a little
4,6,6,"  Why only
5,6,6,Nothing
6,6,6,except that she cared for you and hoped that you would be happy
7,4,4,She was afraid that it would all be strange for you at first
8,6,6,Perhaps I have been interfering
945 7
 (2, 2),
1,6,6,"  they 've been to some meeting
2,4,4,She stood looking at him with her fine steady gaze that had always made him afraid of her
3,6,6,and did so
4,6,6,to his own 3
5,6,6,again now
6,6,6,He had thought that his clothes would have saved him from that
7,6,6,his fingers felt at his button hole .
946 7
 (4, 2),
1,6,6,"  they 've been to some meeting
2,6,3,She stood looking at him with her fine steady gaze that had always made him afraid of her
3,6,6,and did so
4,3,3,to his own 3
5,6,6,again now
6,6,6,He had thought that his clothes would have saved him from that
7,6,6,his fingers felt at his button hole .
947 9
 (8, 7),
1,6,6,"  Why
2,6,6,Mathew
3,6,6,You never told us
4,6,6,I would have hurried back
5,6,6,and now Elizabeth
6,6,6,im afraid
7,6,1,has gone on to see some friends
8,1,disappointed,She will be so disappointed
9,6,6,But at least you 've had Maggie to entertain you .  "
948 5
 (1, 1),
1,0,0,Then as her mind returned back to her uncle she felt with a throb of excited anticipation that perhaps after all this evening was to prove the turning-point of her life
2,6,6,Her little escape into the streets
3,6,6,her posting of the letter
4,6,6,had been followed so immediately by Uncle Mathew 's visit
5,6,6,and now this invitation
949 4
 (1, 2),
1,4,frightened,For a moment Maggie was frightened
2,6,4,She was here in a strange hotel in a strange room with a man whom she scarcely knew
3,6,6,Then she looked up into young Warlock 's face and was reassured
4,6,6,She could trust him .
950 7
 (3, 3),
1,6,6,on his side
2,6,6,as he looked down at her
3,3,3,was 3d at his own excitement
4,6,6,His heart was beating
5,6,6,his hand trembling before this plain
6,6,6,ordinary
7,6,6,unattractive girl
951 6
 (3, 4),
1,6,6,One of the most interesting human beings whom he had ever met
2,6,6,simply because she was utterly unlike any one else
3,1,shame,He felt shame before her
4,6,1,because he knew that she would believe every word that he said
5,6,6,In that she was simple
6,6,6,but  "  he would be bothered if she was simple in anything else .  "
953 4
 (3, 3),
1,6,6,Amy hated him
2,6,6,his mother hid herself from him
3,4,4,and his father 's love frightened him
4,6,6,Already he had found himself telling lies to avoid the chapel services and the meetings with Thurston and the rest .
957 7
 (3, 2),
1,6,6,She loved Martin and Martin loved her

7,6,6,but the sorrow and 5 would be only for a little while
8,6,6,Then Martin and she would live happily together always happily because they were both sensible people
9,6,6,and her own standard of fidelity and trust was
10,6,6,she supposed
11,6,6,also his .

961 8
 (5, 4),
1,6,6,Maggie felt as though she could see the firelight through her body
2,6,6,and with that came also the conviction that Aunt Anne knew everything
3,6,6,knew about Martin and the posted letter and the thoughts of escape
4,6,1,Maggie herself was tired with the trial of her waiting day
5,1,exhausted,she was exhausted and was beating
6,6,6,with all her resolve
7,6,6,against a disappointment that hammered with a thundering noise
8,6,6,somewhere far away in the recesses of her soul .
962 7
 (5, 4),
1,6,6,He greeted the aunts
2,6,6,then shook hands with Maggie
3,6,6,He gave her one glance and she
4,6,4,suddenly feeling that that glance had not the things in it that she had wanted
5,4,frightened,was frightened
6,6,6,her confidence left her
7,6,6,she felt that if she did not have a word alone with him she would die .
963 5
 (1, 3),
1,1,despair,"  I sometimes despair of you
2,6,6,Maggie
3,6,1,You will not think of others
4,6,6,I dont wish to be hard or unjust
5,6,6,but selfishness is the name of your greatest weakness .  "
965 13
 (10, 3),(10, 5),(10, 6),(10, 7),(10, 8),(10, 9),
1,6,6,There seemed to be more of the servant class
2,6,6,rather they were older women with serious rapt expressions and very silent
3,6,4,There were men too
4,6,6,to-night
5,6,4,four or five gathered together inside the passage
6,6,4,standing gravely
7,6,4,without a word
8,6,4,not moving
9,6,4,like statues
10,4,frightened,Maggie was frightened
11,6,6,She felt like a spy in an enemy 's camp
12,6,6,and a spy waiting for an inevitable detection
13,6,6,with no hope of securing any news .
966 4
 (1, 1),
1,0,0,Maggie was maliciously pleased to observe that Miss Avies had not expected these additions to her number and was now in d5 of an uncomfortable squashing
2,6,6,there was
3,6,6,indeed
4,6,6,a polite little struggle between Miss Avies and Aunt Anne as to who should have the corner with a wooden arm upon which to rest .
967 10
 (2, 2),
1,6,6,Miss avies ' two friends
2,3,3,huddled and frightened like fledglings suddenly 3d by a cuckoo
3,6,6,stirred Maggie 's sympathy
4,6,6,She disliked Miss Avies from the very first moment
5,6,6,Miss Avies had a pale
6,6,6,thin
7,6,6,pointed face with no eyebrows
8,6,6,grey eyes dim and short-sighted
9,6,6,and fair colourless hair brushed straight back under a hard
10,6,6,ugly black hat .
968 6
 (5, 5),
1,6,6,Maggie could only see his head and shoulders
2,6,6,but she realised at once that he had been
3,6,6,for a long time
4,6,6,trying to catch her eye
5,0,0,He smiled at her an intimate peculiar smile that sent the blood flooding to her face and made her heart beat with 0
6,6,6,At the moment of her smiling she realised that Miss avies ' dim eye was upon her .
974 5
 (2, 2),
1,6,6,She talked on and on
2,1,1,sometimes her sentences were confused and unfinished
3,6,6,sometimes they seemed to Maggie to have no meaning
4,6,6,once or twice the voice dropped so low that Maggie did not catch the words
5,6,6,but always there was especial urgency behind the carelessness as though every word were being spoken for a listener 's benefit a listener who sat perhaps with pencil and notebook somewhere in the dark behind them .
975 9
 (1, 3),
1,0,glad,But it 's nothing nothing really only im glad
2,6,6,rather
3,6,0,that you should share all our little troubles
4,6,6,because then youll know us better
5,6,6,wont you
6,6,6,Dear Maggie
7,6,6,there 's been something between us all this time
8,6,6,has n't there
9,6,6,Ever since our first meeting and it 's partly been my fault .
977 12
 (3, 3),
1,6,6,im grown up now
2,6,6,i 've got my three hundred pounds and I dont think I want to be religious
3,0,0,im very grateful to you and Aunt Elizabeth
4,6,6,but im not a help to you much
5,6,6,im afraid
6,6,6,I know im very careless
7,6,6,I do want to be better
8,6,6,and that 's all the more reason
9,6,6,perhaps
10,6,6,why I should go out and earn my own living
11,6,6,i 'd learn more quickly then
12,6,6,But I do love you and Aunt Elizabeth
978 2
 (2, 2),
1,6,6,Nevertheless there did come to her suddenly then a new tenderness for her aunt
2,1,1,the actual sight of her pain in the Chapel had deeply touched her and now her eagerness for escape was mingled with a longing to be affectionate and good .
979 5
 (4, 4),
1,6,6,Then Martin had come
2,6,6,and suddenly she had seen how d5ously her life was hemming her in
3,6,6,She was losing courage
4,4,4,She would soon be afraid to speak for herself at all
5,6,6,she would soon
981 10
 (3, 3),
1,6,6,I would n't like to hurt your feelings
2,6,6,Aunt Anne
3,1,1,and it is n't that im not happy with you and Aunt Elizabeth
4,6,6,but I ought to be earning my own living
5,6,6,ought n't I
6,6,6,And i 've only got my three hundred pounds
7,6,6,have n't I
8,6,6,im not complaining
9,6,6,but I dont know about anything yet
10,6,6,do I
982 4
 (1, 1),
1,1,1,Maggie felt ashamed of herself
2,6,6,What desperate silly feelings had she allowed last night
3,6,6,How much she had made of that service
4,6,6,and how weak she was to give way so easily
983 9
 (1, 2),
1,3,3,There to her 3
2,6,3,she found Caroline Smith
3,6,6,The events of the last few days had
4,6,6,a little
5,6,6,dimmed Caroline from her memory
6,6,6,She had not seen Caroline for a fortnight
7,6,6,She did not know that she especially wanted to see Caroline now
8,6,6,However
9,6,6,it was very certain that Caroline wanted to see her .
988 7
 (4, 4),
1,6,6,he did not know whether he liked her it was interest rather that drew him
2,6,6,her strangeness
3,6,6,her strength and loneliness
4,0,0,young and solitary like the moon above him and yet also some feeling softer than interest so that he was suddenly touched as he thought of her and spoke out aloud :   "  i 'll be good to her whatever happens
5,6,6,by God i 'll be good to her
6,6,6,"   so that a chauffeur near him turned and looked with hard scornful eyes
7,6,6,and a girl somewhere laughed .
992 3
 (1, 1),
1,5,5,His mind wandered . He looked about the little room and thought of Thurston . Why was he not more angry about it all
2,6,6,He had pretended to be indignant
3,6,6,he had hated Thurston as he stood there
993 11
 (6, 7),
1,6,6,And this figure
2,6,6,Martin knew
3,6,6,was a prey to every morbid desire
4,6,6,rushed to sensual excess and then crept back miserably to search for some spiritual flagellation
5,6,6,Above all
6,1,restless,it was restless
7,6,1,as some one presses round a dark room searching for the lock of the door
8,6,6,restless and lonely
9,6,6,cowardly and selfish
10,6,6,but searching and sensitive and even faithful
11,6,6,faithful to something or to some one
994 7
 (7, 7),
1,6,6,Miss Pyncheon was the soul of good nature but she was much more than that
2,6,6,She was by far the most sensible
3,6,6,genial
4,6,6,and worldly of the Inside Saints
5,6,6,it was
6,6,6,in fact
7,3,3,astonishing that she should be an Inside Saint at all .
998 5
 (5, 4),
1,6,6,Two events occurred that filled her mind and made the week pass quickly
2,6,6,One was that she received an answer to her adventurous letter
3,6,6,the other was a remarkable conversation with Miss Caroline Smith
4,6,0,The answer to her letter was lying on her plate when she came down to breakfast
5,0,excited,and Aunt Elizabeth was watching it with an excited stare .
999 7
 (7, 6),
1,6,6,"  Oh
2,6,6,nothing
3,6,6,"   said Maggie
4,6,6,slowly
5,6,6,Then she went on
6,6,4,laughing :   "  i 've been asked out to tea for the first time in my life
7,4,frightened,And im terribly frightened .  "
1000 2
 (1, 2),
1,0,unexpected joy,This was unexpected joy to Caroline
2,6,0,who had never imagined that there would be any one so near the Inner Saints as Maggie who yet knew nothing about these recent events .
1001 5
 (4, 3),
1,6,6,"  Two visions
2,6,6,Just like the first
3,6,0,The blazing light and the voice and telling him that the last night of the year 's to be the time
4,0,excitement,Caroline then began to be carried away by her excitement
5,6,6,She talked faster and faster .
1002 7
 (5, 3),
1,6,6,Well
2,6,6,anyway
3,6,4,Miss Avies is the strongest of the lot really
4,6,6,i 'd back her against anybody
5,4,terrified of her,im terrified of her myself
6,6,6,I tell you frankly
7,6,6,She 'd wring any one 's neck for twopence .
1003 8
 (7, 8),
1,6,6,"  Well
2,6,6,I know Martin Warlock 's going to ask me
3,6,6,It 's been getting closer and closer
4,6,6,I expect he will this week
5,6,6,Of course
6,6,6,he is n't so safe as William
7,0,exciting,but he 's much more exciting
8,6,0,And he 's got quite a lot of money of his own .  "
1004 4
 (2, 2),
1,6,6,The boldness
2,0,0,the excitement of this inflamed her
3,6,6,It was so like her to challenge any action once she was in it by taking it to its furthest limit
4,6,6,She put it in an envelope and wrote Martin 's name with a flourish .
1005 3
 (3, 3),
1,6,6,After that abrupt opening there seemed to be nothing to say
2,6,6,Maggie 's thoughts also were elsewhere
3,0,0,She was wishing now passionately that she had not given that note to Caroline .
1006 4
 (2, 3),(4, 3),
1,6,6,Maggie told her about the visit
2,3,curiously,Aunt Anne looked at her curiously
3,6,3,She seemed so weak and frail that Maggie suddenly felt warm maternal love
4,3,shyly,Rather shyly she put her hand upon her aunt 's :   "  I wont go away until you 're better  "
1007 6
 (2, 3),(2, 5),
1,6,6,If Martin could love her it did not matter what others thought nevertheless she pulled her hat about a little and patted her dress
2,1,desperately lonely,The cab stopped and she felt desperately lonely
3,6,1,Did any one care about her anywhere
4,6,6,No
5,6,1,no one
6,6,6,She could have cried with pity at the thought of her own loneliness .
1008 7
 (7, 7),
1,6,6,Some one came forward to her
2,6,6,some one so kind and comforting
3,6,6,so easy and un3d that Maggie suddenly felt herself steadied as though a friend had put an arm around her
4,6,6,Before she had felt :   "  This light I am shabby
5,6,6,Now she felt
6,6,6,"  I am with friendly people
7,3,3,She was 3d at the way that she was suddenly at her ease .
1009 9
 (4, 7),
1,6,6,"  No
2,6,6,"   answered Maggie
3,6,6,"  It is n't that exactly
4,1,not happy,im not happy at home
5,6,6,but I think that 's my fault
6,6,6,My aunts are very good
7,6,1,But I want to be free
8,6,6,It is all very religious where I am
9,6,6,and they want me to believe in their religion .
1010 4
 (3, 3),
1,6,6,It is all very religious where I am
2,6,6,and they want me to believe in their religion
3,4,4,im afraid im not religious at all
4,6,6,Then I dont want to be dependent on people .
1013 8
 (5, 3),
1,6,6,She was confident because she did not think
2,6,6,she simply did not think at all
3,6,0,She loved Martin and Martin loved her
4,6,6,cased in that golden armour
5,0,with a sublime and happy confidence,she confronted her aunts and the house and the world behind the house with a sublime and happy confidence
6,6,6,She loved her aunts now
7,6,6,she loved Martha and the parrot and the cat
8,6,6,and she could not believe that they did not all love her .
1014 5
 (1, 1),
1,1,1,Maggie had an uncomfortable feeling that her aunt had in some way mysteriously defeated her by this sudden abandonment of all protest
2,6,6,and for a moment the mysterious house closed around her
3,6,6,with its shadows and dim corners and the little tinkling Chapel hell in the heart of it
4,6,6,But the thought of Martin dissolved the shadows
5,6,6,and off she went .
1016 4
 (2, 2),
1,6,6,But Maggie had no eloquence in reply she could not make up fine sentences
2,1,1,it embarrassed her dreadfully to tell him even that she loved him
3,6,6,and when he was sentimental it was her habit to turn it off with a joke if she could
4,6,6,She wanted terribly to ask him sometimes what he had meant when he said that he didnt love her as he had loved other women .
1017 7
 (7, 7),
1,6,6,He looked more wandering than ever with his high white collar
2,6,6,his large spectacles
3,6,6,and his thin
4,6,6,dusty hair
5,6,6,the fire of some hidden
6,6,6,vital spirit burnt beneath those glasses
7,1,1,and his face was so kindly that she felt ashamed of herself for having avoided him so often .
1018 5
 (1, 1),
1,4,4,"  It 's terrible all this that 's going on
2,6,6,You know about it
3,6,6,of course Warlock 's visions I mean and the trouble it 's making
4,6,6,im outside it and you 're outside it
5,6,6,but we 're being brought into it all the same how can we help it when we love the people who are in it
1019 5
 (2, 2),(2, 3),(2, 4),
1,6,6,He stopped and there was a long silence between them
2,1,1,Maggie was silent because she never knew what to say when he burst into parables and divided mankind
3,6,1,under strange names
4,6,1,into different camps
5,6,6,And yet this time she did know a little what he was after .
1020 4
 (1, 1),
1,1,1,He cleared his throat as though he were embarrassed and were conscious that he had been making a fool of himself
2,6,6,Maggie felt that he was disappointed in her
3,6,6,She was sorry for that
4,6,6,but she was as she was .
1021 4
 (1, 1),
1,1,1,He cleared his throat as though he were embarrassed and were conscious that he had been making a fool of himself
2,6,6,Maggie felt that he was disappointed in her
3,6,6,She was sorry for that
4,6,6,but she was as she was .
1022 10
 (5, 5),
1,6,6,Her face was white
2,6,6,with the effect of a chalk drawing into which live
3,6,6,black
4,6,6,burning eyes had been stuck
5,4,4,But it was none of these things that frightened Maggie
6,6,6,It was the expression somewhere in the mouth
7,6,6,in the eyes
8,6,6,in the pale bony hands
9,6,6,that spoke of some meeting with a torturer whose powers were almost omniscient almost
10,6,6,but not quite .
1024 4
 (1, 1),
1,0,0,It was as though they both inwardly realised that there was trouble for them of every kind waiting outside and that they could only definitely realise their 0 by building a wall around themselves
2,6,6,They knew perhaps in their secret hearts
3,6,6,or at any rate Martin knew
4,6,6,that they could not hold their castle for long .
1031 6
 (1, 2),(1, 5),
1,0,a terrific excitement,It was a terrific excitement for her
2,6,0,apart altogether from her love for Martin
3,6,6,She had
4,6,6,of course
5,6,0,never been to a theatre
6,6,6,She could not imagine in the least what it was like .
1032 5
 (3, 3),
1,6,6,They started off towards Shaftesbury Avenue where the theatre was
2,6,6,and as they went a funny little incident occurred
3,0,0,They were both too happy to talk and Maggie was too happy even to think
4,6,6,Suddenly she was aware that some one was coming towards her whom she knew
5,6,6,She looked and tugged herself from that world of Martin and only Martin in which she was immersed .

1039 8
 (6, 5),
1,6,6,The Lyric Theatre was their destination
2,6,6,Maggie drew a breath as they stepped into the hall where there stood two large stout commissionaires in blue uniforms
3,6,6,gold buttons
4,6,6,and white gloves
5,6,1,People pushed past them and hurried down the stairs on either side as though a theatre were a Nothing
6,1,feeling lonely,Maggie stood there fingering her gloves and feeling lonely
7,6,6,The oil painting of a beautiful lady with a row of shining teeth faced her
8,6,6,There were also some palms and a hole in the wall with a man behind it .
1040 7
 (6, 6),
1,6,6,As he breathed she breathed too
2,6,6,and it seemed to her that their bodies rose and fell as one body
3,6,6,Without looking directly at him
4,6,6,which would
5,6,6,she knew
6,1,1,embarrass him before all those hungry people behind her
7,6,6,she could out of the corner of her eye see the ruddy brown of his cheek and the hard thick curve of his shoulder .
1041 8
 (2, 2),
1,6,6,But as the play continued she must listen
2,0,0,It was her very first play and soon it was thrilling to her so that she forgot
3,6,6,for a time
4,6,6,even Martin
5,6,6,Or rather Martin was mingled with it
6,6,6,absorbed in it
7,6,6,part of it
8,6,6,and she was there too sharing with him the very action of the story .
1042 11
 (4, 4),
1,6,6,But meanwhile
2,6,6,of course
3,6,6,she saw a handsome young soldier who was young like herself
4,1,1,and she was naturally bored with the studious gentleman
5,6,6,Maggie shared all the feelings of the Charity girl
6,6,6,Had she been brought up
7,6,6,say by a man like Mr
8,6,6,Trenchard and then had met Martin
9,6,6,why
10,6,6,of course
11,6,6,she could have gone only one way .
1043 10
 (3, 3),
1,6,6,Tea came
2,6,6,but she could not eat anything . In some strange way that moment in the theatre when he had pressed her hand had altered everything . She recognised in herself a new Maggie
3,0,0,she was excited with a thick burning excitement
4,6,6,she was almost sleepy with the strain of it and her cheeks were hot
5,6,6,but her throat icy cold . When she told him that she wasnt hungry
6,6,6,he said
7,6,6,"  im not either
8,6,6,Then he added
9,6,6,not looking at her
10,6,6,"  That fellow wont be back for an hour .  "
1045 7
 (2, 2),
1,6,6,Aunt Anne 's aloofness was coloured now with a very human 5
2,3,3,Maggie realised with 3 that she had never seen her angry before
3,6,6,She had been indignant
4,6,6,disapproving
5,6,6,superior
6,6,6,forbidding
7,6,6,but never angry .
1046 8
 (5, 5),
1,6,6,The mist of 5 dimmed the room
2,6,6,it was in the potatoes and the cold dry mutton
3,6,6,especially was it in the hard pallid knobs of cheese
4,6,6,And Aunt Elizabeth
5,4,4,although she was frightened by her sister 's 5 on this occasion
6,6,6,shared in it
7,6,6,She pursed her lips at Maggie and moved her fat
8,6,6,podgy hand as though she would like to smack Maggie 's cheeks .
1047 3
 (1, 2),
1,1,were n't happy,I advised that strongly against my sister 's opinion because I thought you were n't happy
2,6,1,You didnt make friends amongst our friends
3,6,6,and I thought you should have the chance of finding some who were younger and gayer than we were .

6,1,disappointed,I am disappointed in you
7,6,6,bitterly disappointed
8,6,6,I saw from the first that you did not mean to care for us

4,6,0,It had been her own fault for trusting that note to her honour
5,6,6,Caroline had no honour
6,6,6,of course
7,6,6,Maggie might have guessed that from the way that she talked about other people .
1053 8
 (3, 3),
1,6,6,You know me better than any of them do and I am just as you know me
2,6,6,every bit
3,5,5,The aunts are very angry because they say I deceived them
4,6,6,but they have n't any right to tell me who I shall love
5,6,6,have they
6,6,6,No one has
7,6,6,I am myself and nobody 's ever cared for me except you and Uncle Mathew
8,6,6,so I dont see why I should think of anybody .
1055 8
 (6, 7),
1,6,6,She
2,6,6,knowing nothing of the world
3,6,6,could disregard it
4,6,6,but HE knew
5,6,6,knew that daily
6,1,disappointments,hourly recurrence of alights and insults and disappointments
7,6,1,knew what that life could make after a time of women in such a position
8,6,6,even though she did not mind he would mind for her and would reproach himself continually .

1,6,1,"  But if you go on like this youll be so that you cant go on any longer
2,1,break down,youll break down

4,6,6,You are n't taking any care at all .  "
1059 7
 (4, 4),
1,6,6,She returned safely
2,6,6,Jane opened the door for her
3,6,6,mysteriously
4,0,0,as though she enjoyed her share in the conspiracy
5,6,6,Maggie sped upstairs
6,6,6,and now with Martin 's words in her ears
7,6,6,had enough to stiffen her back for the battle .
1060 12
 (4, 4),
1,6,6,Smith 's
2,6,6,coarse and vulgar
3,6,6,out for any sensation that might come along
4,1,1,and ready instantly to express their contempt if the particular  "  trick "   that they were expecting failed to come off
5,6,6,other faces
6,6,6,again
7,6,6,like Amy Warlock 's
8,6,6,grimly set upon secret thoughts and purposes of their own
9,6,6,faces trained to withstand any sudden attack on the emotions
10,6,6,but eager
11,6,6,too
12,6,6,like the rest for some revelation that was to answer all questions and satisfy all expectations .
1061 19
 (15, 6),(15, 7),(15, 8),(15, 9),(15, 10),
1,6,6,Maggie wondered
2,6,6,as she looked about her
3,6,6,how she could have raised in her own imagination
4,6,6,around the Chapel and its affairs
5,6,6,so formidable an atmosphere of terror and tyrannic discipline
6,6,1,Here gathered together were a few women
7,6,1,tired
8,6,1,pale
9,6,1,many of them uneducated
10,6,1,awaiting like children the opening of a box
11,6,6,the springing into flower of a dry husk of a seed
12,6,6,the raising of the curtain on some wonderful scene
13,6,6,Maggie
14,6,6,as she looked at them
15,1,disappointed,knew that they must be disappointed
16,6,6,and her heart ached for them all
17,6,6,yes
18,6,6,even for Amy Warlock
19,6,6,her declared enemy .
1063 8
 (2, 2),
1,6,6,Only Martin was flesh and blood
2,4,4,to be loved and longed for and 4ed for just as he had always been
3,6,6,All the physical properties of life clothes
4,6,6,food
5,6,6,household possessions
6,6,6,money became of less and less importance to him
7,6,6,Had Amy not watched over him he would have been many days without any food at all
8,6,6,and one day he come into the living-room at breakfast time clothed in a towel .
1064 9
 (3, 4),(3, 5),(3, 6),
1,6,6,"  He 's only a boy
2,6,6,"   she used to say to herself and feel his elder by at least twenty years
3,1,not a happy one,Nevertheless the thought of his struggling on there alone was not a happy one
4,6,1,She longed
5,6,1,even though she might not advise him
6,6,1,to comfort him
7,6,6,She was beginning to realise something of her own power over him and to see
8,6,6,too
9,6,6,the strange mixture of superstition and self reproach and self distrust that overwhelmed him when she was not with him .
1065 7
 (3, 3),
1,6,6,Maggie thought
2,6,6,watching her aunt 's austere composure from the other side of the dining table
3,1,1,She was sad at the thought of that
4,6,6,remembering moments that first visit to St
5,6,6,Dreot 's
6,6,6,the departure in the cab
7,6,6,the night when she had sat at her aunt 's bedside that had given glimpses of the kind human creature Aunt Anne might have been had she never heard of the Inside Saints .
1066 4
 (1, 1),
1,3,3,When the last day of the year arrived Maggie was 3d at the strange excitement that she felt
2,6,6,It was excitement
3,6,6,not only because of the dim mysterious events that the evening promised
4,6,6,but also because she was sure that this day would settle the loneliness of herself and Martin .
1067 8
 (7, 1),(7, 2),(7, 3),
1,6,4,She had not been certain
2,6,4,all this time
3,6,4,whether the aunts meant to take her to the service with them
4,6,6,She had supposed that her introduction to the meeting at Miss Avies 's meant that they intended to include her in this too
5,6,6,but now
6,6,6,as the evening advanced
7,4,terror,in a fit of nervous terror she prayed within herself that they would not take her
8,6,6,If the end of the world were coming she would like to meet it in her bed .
1068 8
 (8, 8),
1,6,6,"  It 's a quarter past eleven
2,6,6,It 's time to put on your things
3,6,6,"   she said
4,6,6,So she was to go
5,6,6,She rose and
6,6,6,in spite of herself
7,6,6,her limbs were trembling and her teeth chattered
8,3,3,To her 3 Aunt Anne bent forward and kissed her on the forehead .
1069 5
 (3, 3),
1,6,6,"  Maggie
2,6,6,"   she said
3,1,1,"  if i 've been harsh to you during these weeks im sorry
4,6,6,i 've done what I thought my duty
5,6,6,but I would n't wish on this night that we should have any unkindness in our hearts towards one another .  "
1070 2
 (1, 1),
1,0,0,She was now so touched by the pathos of his helplessness that she could think of nothing else and longed to go to him and comfort him
2,6,6,Time stole on and it was now ten minutes to twelve .

1,1,1,She was now so touched by the pathos of his helplessness that she could think of nothing else and longed to go to him and comfort him
2,6,6,Time stole on and it was now ten minutes to twelve .
1072 7
 (2, 2),
1,6,6,When she saw him she stood speechless where she was
2,4,4,The change in him terrified her so that her heart seemed to leap into her throat choking her
3,6,6,The colour had drained from his face
4,6,6,leaving it dry and yellow
5,6,6,He had an amazing resemblance to his father
6,6,6,his eyes had exactly the same bewildered expression as though he were lost and yet he seemed quite calm
7,6,6,his only movement was one hand that wandered up and down his waistcoat feeling the buttons one after the other .
1073 8
 (7, 6),
1,6,6,"  But you 're quite wrong
2,6,6,Miss Avies
3,6,6,i 've no intention of not facing Martin
4,6,6,and i 've no intention either of having my life ruined because he 's not here
5,6,6,At first
6,6,1,when I was very ill
7,1,unhappy,I was unhappy
8,6,6,and then I saw how silly I was .  "
1074 7

5,6,3,"  How can you say you loved one another if you were always quarrelling and expecting to part
6,6,6,"    "  We were n't always quarrelling
7,6,6,"   said Maggie .
1075 9
 (2, 5),
1,6,6,When Katherine Mark came in Maggie was writing to Uncle Mathew
2,3,3,She put aside her writing - pad with a little exclamation of 3
3,6,6,Mrs
4,6,6,Mark
5,6,3,the very last person in all the world whom she had expected to see
6,6,6,As she saw her come in she had a swift intuition that this was Destiny now that was dealing with her
7,6,6,and that a new scene
8,6,6,involving every sort of new experience and adventure
9,6,6,was opening before her .
1076 12
 (7, 6),
1,6,6,"  I wrote
2,6,6,"   she said
3,6,6,"  some weeks ago to you

1078 7
 (5, 6),(5, 7),
1,6,6,"  You know that it 's better for me to go
2,6,6,"   said Maggie
3,6,6,"  We cant live together any more after what happened
4,6,6,You and Aunt Elizabeth have been very very good to me
5,1,disappointment,but you know now that im a disappointment
6,6,1,I have n't ever fitted into the life here
7,6,1,I never shall .  "

 (7, 8),
1,6,6,He did indeed seem to lead a mysterious life of his own and paid very little attention to Maggie
2,6,6,asking her once whether she did not think The Golden Ass wonderful
3,6,6,and what did she think of Petronius
4,6,6,and when Maggie laughed and said that she was glad to say she never read anything
5,6,6,he left her in an agitated horror
6,6,6,Lady Rachel Seddon was very grand and splendid
7,4,frightened,and frightened Katherine
8,6,4,She was related to every kind of duke and marquis
9,6,6,and although that fact did not impress Maggie in the least
10,6,6,it did seem to remove Lady Rachel into quite another world .
1082 8
 (4, 4),
1,6,6,He was supported in his confidence by his sister Grace
2,6,6,who obviously adored him
3,6,6,She too was  "  outside "   the family
4,0,0,but she seemed to be quite happy telling endless stories of Paul 's courage and cleverness and popularity
5,6,6,She did indeed believe that skeaton on sea
6,6,6,where Paul had his living
7,6,6,was the hub of the universe
8,6,6,and this amused all the Trenchard family very much indeed .
1083 6
 (6, 6),
1,6,6,They could be warm-hearted
2,6,6,it was wonderful to see the way that they all adored Katherine
3,6,6,and they had many friends for whom they would do anything
4,6,6,but the Rev
5,6,6,Paul seemed to them frankly an ass
6,0,0,and they would be glad when he went away .
1084 12
 (3, 3),
1,6,6,With Paul Trenchard there was no effort
2,6,6,no deliberate slipping out of one world into another one
3,0,0,He was frankly delighted to tell Maggie everything all about skeaton on Sea and its delights
4,6,6,about the church and its marvellous east window
5,6,6,about the choir and the difficulties with the choir boys and the necessity for repairing the organ
6,6,6,about the troubles with the churchwardens
7,6,6,especially one Mr
8,6,6,Bellows
9,6,6,who
10,6,6,in his cantankerous and dyspeptic objections to everything that any one proposed
11,6,6,became quite a lively figure to Maggie 's imagination
12,6,6,about the St .
1085 9
 (4, 4),
1,6,6,Maggie rebuked herself for thinking this
2,6,6,but again and again the thought arose
3,6,6,Grace was in a state of perpetual wonder
4,3,3,everything amazed her
5,6,6,You would not think to look at her flat broad placidity that she was a creature of excitement
6,6,6,and it might be that her excitement was rather superficial

8,6,6,should have a rest
9,6,6,At the same time she did not at all want to surrender the power that doing these things had given her .
1109 3
 (1, 1),
1,3,3,She then would  "  lose her temper "   so much to her own 3 that she at once decided that some one else must be responsible
2,6,6,A few days after her return she decided that she  "  must not let these things go
3,6,6,"   so she told Maggie that she would attend the Committee of Old Women 's Comforts and be responsible for the Choir practice .
1112 4
 (3, 3),
1,6,6,She had never been a very great talker
2,6,6,she had nothing much to say unless to some one in whom she was interested
3,4,4,She was frightened lest something should happen to the tea
4,6,6,and she felt that they were all staring at her and asking themselves why her hair was cut short and why her clothes didnt fit better .
1113 8
 (6, 6),
1,6,6,"  I dont want to curse you
2,6,6,Caroline
3,6,6,"   said Maggie

5,6,6,Tea will be here in a minute
6,1,1,I was very unhappy about what you did
7,6,6,but that 's all a long time ago now
8,6,6,and I was to blame too .  "
1114 10
 (4, 4),
1,6,6,It may be said
2,6,6,however
3,6,6,in Grace 's defence that she gave Maggie every chance
4,3,3,She marvelled at her own patience
5,6,6,For two years after that moment
6,6,6,when she decided that Maggie was  "  queer
7,6,6,"   and that her beloved Paul was in real d5 of his losing his soul because of that  "  queerness
8,6,6,"   she held her hand
9,6,6,She was not naturally a patient woman she was not introspective enough to be that and she held no brief for Maggie
10,6,6,Nevertheless for two whole years she held her hand
1115 8
 (5, 3),(5, 4),
1,6,6,Then
2,6,6,when in the dusk of that summer evening
3,6,4,she saw Paul kiss Maggie
4,6,4,as the moths blundered about her lamp
5,4,terrified,her stolid unimaginative heart was terrified
6,6,6,This girl
7,6,6,who was she
8,6,6,What had she been before they found her
1117 10
 (7, 7),
1,6,6,His whole nature was easy
2,6,6,genial
3,6,6,and
4,6,6,above all
5,6,6,lazy
6,6,6,He liked to be liked
7,3,3,and she Was often astonished at the pleasure with which he received compliments
8,6,6,He had a conceit of himself
9,6,6,not as a man but as a clergyman
10,6,6,and she knew that nothing pleased him so much as when people praised his  "  good natured humanity .
1146 3
 (2, 2),
1,6,6,"  It is a world 's wonder
2,3,3,There is only one thing that 3s me
3,6,6,Was it by accident that one window was left unfinished
1150 7
 (4, 3),
1,6,6,The following day a grand dinner was served to us but as my wife did not appear
2,6,6,I ordered a servant to call her
3,6,2,Still she did not come
4,2,impatiently,and I waited impatiently for some time
5,6,6,At last she entered the room
6,6,6,and she took our places at the table
7,6,6,and plates of rice were set before us .
1158 4
 (2, 1),
1,6,4,Being ambitious to get ahead socially and financially
2,4,very careful,he was very careful of whom or with whom he talked
3,6,6,He was as much afraid of Agatha 's she had expressing a rabid or unpopular political or social opinion as he was of being seen with an evil character
4,6,6,though he had really no opinion of great political significance to express .

1,6,6,The Cowperwoods
2,6,6,father and mother
3,6,6,were not so lean and narrow that they could not enter into the natural tendency to be happy and joyous with their children
4,6,6,and so this family
5,6,0,which increased at the rate of a child every two or three years after Frank 's birth until there were four children
6,0,interesting,was quite an interesting affair when he was ten and they were ready to move into the New Market Street home
7,6,6,Henry Worthington Cowperwood 's connections were increased as his position grew more responsible
8,6,6,and gradually he was becoming quite a personage .

2,6,6,Jr
3,6,6,was born
4,6,6,for Mrs
5,6,6,Cowperwood was frightened
6,6,6,He 4ed for the beauty of her body troubled over the d5 of losing her
7,6,6,and he actually endured his first worry when he stood outside the door the day the child came
8,6,6,Not much he was too self sufficient
9,6,6,too resourceful
10,4,worried,and yet he worried
11,6,4,conjuring up thoughts of death and the end of their present state
12,6,6,Then word came
13,6,6,after certain piercing
14,6,6,harrowing cries
15,6,6,that all was well
16,6,6,and he was permitted to look at the new arrival .
1222 9
 (4, 4),
1,6,6,The children took up a great deal of her time
2,6,6,However
3,6,6,Cowperwood was not troubled about this
4,0,0,It struck him as delightful and exceedingly worth while that she should be so devoted
5,6,6,At the same time
6,6,6,her lethargic manner
7,6,6,vague smile and her sometimes seeming indifference
8,6,6,which sprang largely from a sense of absolute security

1228 14
 (4, 4),
1,6,6,Cowperwood
2,6,6,warm with this enhancing of his financial prospects
3,6,6,went down the steps
4,0,0,but incidentally he spared a passing thought for the gay spirit of youth that had manifested itself in this red cheeked maiden
5,6,6,What a bright
6,6,6,healthy
7,6,6,bounding girl
8,6,6,Her voice had the subtle
9,6,6,vigorous ring of fifteen or sixteen
10,6,6,She was all vitality
11,6,6,What a fine catch for some young fellow some day
12,6,6,and her father would make him rich
13,6,6,no doubt
14,6,6,or help to .
1231 16
 (16, 3),
1,6,6,She had already learned that the Butlers were rather showy the younger generation that they were sensitive as to their lineage
2,6,6,and that money in their estimation was supposed to make up for any deficiency in any other respect
3,6,0,"  Butler himself is a very presentable man
4,6,6,"   Cowperwood had once remarked to her
5,6,6,"  but Mrs
6,6,6,Butler well
7,6,6,she 's all right
8,6,6,but she 's a little commonplace
9,6,6,She 's a fine woman
10,6,6,though
11,6,6,I think
12,6,6,good natured and good-hearted
13,6,6,He cautioned her not to overlook Aileen and Norah
14,6,6,because the Butlers
15,6,6,mother and father
16,0,very proud,were very proud of them .

7,6,6,Her face was hollow cheeked
8,6,6,like so many of Rossetti 's and Burne-Jones 's women
9,6,4,Her health was really not as good as it had been the care of two children and a late undiagnosed tendency toward gastritis having reduced her
10,4,nervously,In short she was a little run down nervously and suffered from fits of depression .

11,6,6,Cowperwood had noticed this
12,6,6,He tried to be gentle and considerate
13,6,6,but he was too much of a utilitarian and practical minded observer not to realize that he was likely to have a sickly wife on his hands later .
1234 9
 (4, 3),
1,6,6,Sympathy and affection were great things
2,6,6,but desire and charm must endure or one was compelled to be sadly conscious of their loss

10,6,6,was a man entitled to only one wife
11,6,6,Must he never look at another woman
12,6,6,Supposing he found some one
13,6,6,He pondered those things between hours of labor
14,6,6,and concluded that it did not make so much difference
15,6,6,If a man could
16,6,6,and not be exposed
17,6,6,it was all right
18,6,6,He had to be careful
19,6,6,though
20,6,6,Tonight
21,6,6,as he sat on the side of his wife 's bed
22,6,6,he was thinking somewhat of this
23,6,6,for he had seen Aileen Butler again
24,6,6,playing and singing at her piano as he passed the parlor door
25,6,6,She was like a bright bird radiating health and enthusiasm a reminder of youth in general .
1242 18
 (14, 2),
1,6,6,Aileen always reminded Cowperwood of a high stepping horse without a check rein
2,6,0,He met her at various times
3,6,6,shopping with her mother
4,6,6,out driving with her father
5,6,6,and he was always interested and amused at the affected
6,6,6,bored tone she assumed before him the  "  Oh
7,6,6,dear
8,6,6,Oh
9,6,6,dear
10,6,6,Life is so tiresome
11,6,6,dont you know
12,6,6,"   when
13,6,6,as a matter of fact
14,0,thrilling interest,every moment of it was of thrilling interest to her
15,6,6,Cowperwood took her mental measurement exactly
16,6,6,A girl with a high sense of life in her
17,6,6,romantic
18,6,6,full of the thought of love and its possibilities .
1243 8
 (6, 6),
1,6,6,Intelligence
2,6,6,of a raw
3,6,6,crude order she had certainly also a native force
4,6,6,tamed somewhat by the doctrines and conventions of current society
5,6,6,still showed clear at times in an elemental and not entirely unattractive way
6,0,0,At this time she was only eighteen years of age decidedly attractive from the point of view of a man of Frank Cowperwood 's temperament
7,6,6,She supplied something he had not previously known or consciously craved
8,6,6,Vitality and vivacity .
1244 9
 (1, 1),
1,4,4,But these facts of wealth and advantage gripped her
2,6,6,and when she sat at the piano and played or rode in her carriage or walked or stood before her mirror
3,6,6,she was conscious of her figure
4,6,6,her charms
5,6,6,what they meant to men
6,6,6,how women envied her
7,6,6,Sometimes she looked at poor
8,6,6,hollow chested or homely faced girls and felt sorry for them
9,6,6,at other times she flared into inexplicable opposition to some handsome girl or woman who dared to brazen her socially or physically .
1245 9
 (2, 1),
1,6,0,"  Wait till you see them
2,0,pleased,I think you will be pleased
3,6,6,Mr
4,6,6,Cowperwood
5,6,6,I am taking especial pains with yours because it is smaller
6,6,6,It is really easier to treat your father 's
7,6,6,But yours  "   He went off into a description of the entrance hall
8,6,6,reception room and parlor
9,6,6,which he was arranging and decorating in such a way as to give an effect of size and dignity not really conformable to the actual space .
1247 11
 (7, 5),
1,6,6,There were then two famous American sculptors
2,6,6,Powers and Hosmer
3,6,6,of whose work he had examples
4,6,6,but Ellsworth told him that they were not the last word in sculpture and that he should look into the merits of the ancients
5,6,0,He finally secured a head of David
6,6,6,by Thorwaldsen
7,0,delighted him,which delighted him
8,6,6,and some landscapes by Hunt
9,6,6,Sully
10,6,6,and Hart
11,6,6,which seemed somewhat in the spirit of his new world .
1252 5
 (1, 1),
1,1,1,Butler was sorry that he had called his youngest a baggage
2,6,6,but these children God bless his soul were a great annoyance

5,6,6,wasnt this house good enough for them

 (8, 8),
1,6,6,But no
2,6,6,her father
3,6,6,whom she loved dearly
4,6,6,was of the old school
5,6,6,He was just what people charged him with being
6,6,6,a rough Irish contractor
7,6,6,He might be rich
8,5,5,She flared up at the injustice of things why could n't he have been rich and refined
9,6,6,too
10,6,6,Then they could have but
11,6,6,oh
12,6,6,what was the use of complaining
13,6,6,They would never get anywhere with her father and mother in charge
14,6,6,She would just have to wait
15,6,6,Marriage was the answer the right marriage
16,6,6,But whom was she to marry
1255 12
 (8, 6),(8, 7),
1,6,6,It was curious
2,6,6,though
3,6,6,that it was Aileen who commanded nearly all their attention and fixed their minds on her so-called idiosyncrasies
4,6,6,All they said was in its peculiar way true
5,6,6,but in addition the girl was really beautiful and much above the average intelligence and force
6,6,5,She was running deep with ambition
7,6,5,and she was all the more conspicuous
8,5,irritating,and in a way irritating to some
9,6,6,because she reflected in her own consciousness her social defects
10,6,6,against which she was inwardly fighting
11,6,6,She resented the fact that people could justly consider her parents ineligible
12,6,6,and for that reason her also .

1,6,6,"  It 's perfectly lovely

3,6,6,Mrs
4,6,6,Butler
5,6,6,"   commented Mrs
6,6,6,Cowperwood
7,4,4,a little bit nervous because of others .
1259 6
 (5, 4),
1,6,6,Aileen had swept on to Cowperwood and his mother
2,6,6,who was near him
3,6,6,She had removed from her arm the black satin ribbon which held her train and kicked the skirts loose and free
4,6,0,Her eyes gleamed almost pleadingly for all her hauteur
5,0,spirited,like a spirited collie 's
6,6,6,and her even teeth showed beautifully .
1260 11
 (5, 4),(6, 4),
1,6,6,He did not know why he said this
2,6,6,He was not especially poetic
3,6,6,He had not formulated the phrase beforehand
4,6,0,Since his first glimpse of her in the hall
5,0,spirited,his feelings and ideas had been leaping and plunging like spirited horses
6,0,set his teeth and narrow his eyes,This girl made him set his teeth and narrow his eyes
7,6,6,Involuntarily he squared his jaw
8,6,6,looking more defiant
9,6,6,forceful
10,6,6,efficient
11,6,6,as she drew near
1261 28
 (25, 22),
1,6,6,She had stood before her mirror between eight and nine it was nine fifteen before she was really ready and pondered over what she should wear
2,6,6,There were two tall pier glasses in her wardrobe  an unduly large piece of furniture and one in her closet door
3,6,6,She stood before the latter
4,6,6,looking at her bare arms and shoulders
5,6,6,her shapely figure
6,6,6,thinking of the fact that her left shoulder had a dimple
7,6,6,and that she had selected garnet garters decorated with heart-shaped silver buckles
8,6,6,The corset could not be made quite tight enough at first
9,6,6,and she chided her maid
10,6,6,Kathleen Kelly
11,6,6,She studied how to arrange her hair
12,6,6,and there was much ado about that before it was finally adjusted
13,6,6,She penciled her eyebrows and plucked at the hair about her forehead to make it loose and shadowy
14,6,6,She cut black court plaster with her nail shears and tried different-sized pieces in different places
15,6,6,Finally
16,6,6,she found one size and one place that suited her
17,6,6,She turned her head from side to side
18,6,6,looking at the combined effect of her hair
19,6,6,her penciled brows
20,6,6,her dimpled shoulder
21,6,6,and the black beauty spot
22,6,4,If some one man could see her as she was now
23,6,6,some time
24,6,6,Which man
25,4,frightened,That thought scurried back like a frightened rat into its hole
26,6,6,She was

1263 10
 (3, 5),
1,6,6,And then she came to the matter of a train gown
2,6,6,Kathleen laid out five
3,0,honor,for Aileen had come into the joy and honor of these things recently
4,6,6,and she had
5,6,0,with the permission of her mother and father
6,6,6,indulged herself to the full
7,6,6,She studied a golden-yellow silk
8,6,6,with cream lace shoulder straps
9,6,6,and some gussets of garnet beads in the train that shimmered delightfully
10,6,6,but set it aside .
1264 14
 (10, 10),
1,6,6,Then she put on the black silk with its glistening crimsoned silver sequins
2,6,6,and
3,6,6,lo
4,6,6,it touched her
5,6,6,She liked its coquettish drapery of tulle and silver about the hips
6,6,6,The  "  overskirt
7,6,6,"   which was at that time just coming into fashion
8,6,6,though avoided by the more conservative
9,6,6,had been adopted by Aileen with enthusiasm
10,0,0,She thrilled a little at the rustle of this black dress
11,6,6,and thrust her chin and nose forward to make it set right
12,6,6,Then after having Kathleen tighten her corsets a little more
13,6,6,she gathered the train over her arm by its train band and looked again
14,6,6,Something was wanting .
1265 15
 (7, 6),
1,6,6,While he was dancing first with Mrs
2,6,6,Cowperwood and later with Mrs
3,6,6,Seneca Davis
4,6,6,and still later with Mrs
5,6,6,Martyn Walker
6,6,0,Cowperwood had occasion to look at Aileen often
7,0,a sense of great vigor,and each time that he did so there swept over him a sense of great vigor there
8,6,6,of beautiful if raw
9,6,6,dynamic energy that to him was irresistible and especially so to-night
10,6,6,She was so young
11,6,6,She was beautiful
12,6,6,this girl
13,6,6,and in spite of his wife 's repeated derogatory comments he felt that she was nearer to his clear
14,6,6,aggressive
15,6,6,unblinking attitude than any one whom he had yet seen in the form of woman .
1271 15
 (3, 4),
1,6,6,Cowperwood understood
2,6,6,He walked away
3,4,nervous,He was quite warm and tense now almost nervous
4,6,4,It was quite clear to him that he had done or was contemplating perhaps a very treacherous thing
5,6,6,Under the current code of society he had no right to do it
6,6,6,It was against the rules
7,6,6,as they were understood by everybody
8,6,6,Her father
9,6,6,for instance his father every one in this particular walk of life
10,6,6,However
11,6,6,much breaking of the rules under the surface of things there might be
12,6,6,the rules were still there
13,6,6,As he had heard one young man remark once at school
14,6,6,when some story had been told of a boy leading a girl astray and to a disastrous end
15,6,6,"  That is n't the way at all .  "
1272 8
 (6, 6),
1,6,6,Still
2,6,6,now that he had said this
3,6,6,strong thoughts of her were in his mind
4,6,6,And despite his involved social and financial position
5,6,6,which he now recalled
6,0,0,it was interesting to him to see how deliberately and even calculatingly and worse
7,6,6,enthusiastically  he was pumping the bellows that tended only to heighten the flames of his desire for this girl
8,6,6,to feed a fire that might ultimately consume him and how deliberately and resourcefully
1274 14
 (4, 5),
1,6,6,Instead of dwelling on the works of nature
2,6,6,its beauty and subtlety
3,6,6,to his material disadvantage
4,0,happy,he found a happy mean
5,6,0,owing to the swiftness of his intellectual operations
6,6,6,whereby he could
7,6,6,intellectually and emotionally
8,6,6,rejoice in the beauty of life without interfering with his perpetual material and financial calculations
9,6,6,And when it came to women and morals
10,6,6,which involved so much relating to beauty
11,6,6,0
12,6,6,a sense of distinction and variety in living
13,6,6,he was but now beginning to suspect for himself at least that apart from maintaining organized society in its present form there was no basis for this one life
14,6,6,one love idea .

12,6,6,' thought Alice to herself
13,6,6,after such a fall as this
14,6,6,I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs
15,6,6,How brave they 'll all think me at home
16,6,6,Why
17,6,6,I would n't say anything about it
18,6,6,even if I fell off the top of the house
1914 11
 (4, 4),
1,6,6,And so it was indeed :  she was now only ten inches high
2,6,6,and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden First
3,6,6,however
4,4,4,she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further :  she felt a little nervous about this
5,6,6,for it might end
6,6,6,you know
7,6,6,' said Alice to herself
8,6,6,in my going out altogether
9,6,6,like a candle . I wonder what I should be like then
10,6,6,' And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out
11,6,6,for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing
1915 22
 (17, 17),
1,6,6,Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table :  she opened it
2,6,6,and found in it a very small cake
3,6,6,on which the words  ' EAT ME ' were beautifully marked in currants Well
4,6,6,i 'll eat it
5,6,6,' said Alice
6,6,6,and if it makes me grow larger
7,6,6,I can reach the key
8,6,6,and if it makes me grow smaller
9,6,6,I can creep under the door
10,6,6,so either way i 'll get into the garden
11,6,6,and I dont care which happens
12,6,6,' She ate a little bit
13,6,6,and said anxiously to herself
14,6,6,Which way
15,6,6,Which way
16,6,6,holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing
17,3,3,and she was quite 3d to find that she remained the same size :  to be sure
18,6,6,this generally happens when one eats cake
19,6,6,but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen
20,6,6,that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way
21,6,6,she set to work
22,6,6,and very soon finished off the cake .

1932 10
 (6, 5),
1,6,6,All conversation was kept between the two queens
2,6,6,but her Wichwezi majesty had a platter of clay stone brought
3,6,6,which she ate with great relish
4,6,6,making a noise of satisfaction like a happy guinea pig
5,6,3,She threw me a bit
6,3,3,which to the 3 of everybody
7,6,6,I caught and threw it into my mouth
8,6,6,thinking it was some confection
9,6,6,but the harsh taste soon made me spit it out again
10,6,6,to the amusement of the company .
1936 7
 (3, 3),
1,6,6,It was the window of a jeweller whose diamonds and  sapphires seemed to laugh
2,6,6,in flashes like high notes of sound
3,0,0,with the mere joy of knowing how much more they were  "  worth "   than  most of the dingy pedestrians staring at them from the other side  of the pane
4,6,6,Stransom lingered long enough to suspend
5,6,6,in a  vision
6,6,6,a string of pearls about the white neck of Mary Antrim
7,6,6,and  then was kept an instant longer by the sound of a voice he knew .

1942 14
 (13, 14),
1,6,6,Bruno thought about it
2,6,6,' well
3,6,6,I would n't like it if you were n't there
4,6,6,' he said
5,6,6,because that was the truth
6,6,6,' so you 'd prefer to stay here with me
7,6,6,i 'd prefer all four of us to stay together
8,6,6,' he said
9,6,6,reluctantly including Gretel in that
10,6,6,' whether that was in Berlin or out with
11,6,6,' oh
12,6,6,Bruno
13,5,exasperated,' said Gretel in an exasperated voice
14,6,5,and he didnt know whether that was because he might be spoiling the plans for their return or because ( according to her ) he continued to mispronounce the name of their home .
1943 9
 (4, 4),
1,6,6,' what do you mean there are hundreds of children over there
2,6,6,' asked Father
3,6,6,' what do you know of what goes on over there
4,4,4,' Bruno opened his mouth to speak but worried that he would get himself into trouble if he revealed too much
5,6,6,' i can see them from my bedroom window
6,6,6,' he said finally
7,6,6,' theyre very far away of course
8,6,6,but it looks like there are hundreds
9,6,6,All wearing the striped pyjamas . '
1952 13
 (10, 9),
1,6,6,' anyway
2,6,6,' said Bruno after a suitable pause
3,6,6,not wishing to discuss that topic any further
4,6,6,' i have something to tell you too
5,6,6,You do
6,6,6,' asked Shmuel
7,6,6,looking up hopefully
8,6,6,' yes
9,6,3,im going back to Berlin
10,3,3,Shmuel 's mouth dropped open in 3
11,6,6,' when
12,6,6,' he asked
13,6,6,his voice catching slightly in his throat as he did so .
1953 16
 (14, 15),
1,6,6,He said the word ' home '
2,6,6,despite the fact that he wasnt sure where ' home ' was any more
3,6,6,' so I wont see you again
4,6,6,' asked Shmuel
5,6,6,' well
6,6,6,someday
7,6,6,yes

9,6,6,' you could come on a holiday to Berlin

11,6,6,Can you
12,6,6,' shmuel shook his head
13,6,6,' i suppose not
14,1,sadly,' he said sadly
15,6,1,' i wont have anyone to talk to any more when you 're gone
16,6,6,' he added .
1954 10
 (6, 4),
1,6,6,' no

3,6,6,He wanted to add the words
4,6,1,' i 'll miss you too
5,6,6,Shmuel
6,1,embarrassed,' to the sentence but found that he was a little embarrassed to say them
7,6,6,' so tomorrow will be the last time we see each other until then
8,6,6,' he continued

1956 4
 (3, 4),
1,6,6,' that 's true
2,6,6,' said Shmuel
3,1,tears,lowering the fence again and looking at the ground with tears in his eyes
4,6,1,I suppose i 'll see you tomorrow to say goodbye then . '
1957 8
 (6, 4),(6, 5),
1,6,6,' well
2,6,6,if that 's the case

6,0,broke into a wide smile,Shmuel 's face brightened up and he broke into a wide smile
7,6,6,' do you think so
8,6,6,' he asked .
1958 10
 (7, 5),(7, 6),
1,6,6,Shmuel shook his head
2,6,6,' that 's all right
3,6,6,' he said

1959 5
 (2, 2),
1,6,6,The next day Friday was another wet day
2,1,1,When Bruno woke in the morning he looked out of his window and was disappointed to see the rain pouring down
3,6,6,Had it not been for the fact that it would be the last chance for him and Shmuel to spend any time together not to mention the fact that the adventure would be a very exciting one
4,6,6,especially since it involved dressing up he would have given up on it for the day and waited until some afternoon the following week
5,6,6,when he didnt have anything special planned .
1960 15
 (15, 3),
1,6,6,' hello
2,6,6,Bruno
3,6,0,' he said when he saw his friend approaching

6,6,6,' said Bruno
7,6,6,' i wasnt sure if we 'd ever see each other again with the rain and everything
8,6,6,I mean
9,6,6,' said Shmuel
10,6,6,' i thought you might be kept indoors
11,6,6,' it was touch and go for a while
12,6,6,' said Bruno
13,6,6,' what with the weather being so bad
14,6,6,Shmuel nodded and held out his hands to Bruno
15,0,opened his mouth in delight,who opened his mouth in delight .
1961 7
 (4, 2),
1,6,6,Shmuel pointed at Bruno 's feet and the heavy boots he had taken from the house

13,4,4,At first it felt horrible putting his bare feet into so much mud
14,6,6,they sank down to his ankles and every time he lifted a foot it felt worse .
1964 5
 (4, 3),(4, 4),
1,6,6,Shmuel reached down and lifted the base of the fence
2,6,6,but it only lifted to a certain height and Bruno had no choice but to roll under it
3,6,0,getting his striped pyjamas completely covered in mud as he did so
4,0,0,He laughed when he looked down at himself

7,6,6,unaccustomed to being on the same side of the fence .
1967 11
 (10, 10),
1,6,6,Bruno thought about it
2,6,6,He had promised his friend that and he wasnt the sort to go back on a promise
3,6,6,especially when it was the last time they were going to see each other
4,6,6,' all right
5,6,6,' he said
6,6,6,although he felt a lot less confident now than he had before
7,6,6,' but where should we look
8,6,6,you said we 'd need to find evidence
9,6,6,' said Shmuel
10,1,1,who was feeling upset because he thought that if Bruno didnt help him
11,6,6,then who would
1968 8
 (4, 1),
1,6,1,But they didnt find anything at all that might give them a clue to Shmuel 's papa 's disappearance
2,6,6,and it started to get darker

6,6,6,most of them being pushed together by the soldiers
7,6,6,so that he and Shmuel were hidden in the centre of them and could n't be seen .
1974 13
 (7, 5),(7, 6),
1,6,6,' does the marching go on for long
2,6,6,' he whispered because he was beginning to feel quite hungry now
3,6,6,' i dont think so

5,6,3,' i never see the people after they 've gone on a march
6,6,3,But I would n't imagine it does
7,3,frowned,Bruno frowned
8,6,6,He looked up at the sky
9,6,6,and as he did so there was another loud sound
10,6,6,this time the sound of thunder overhead
11,6,6,and just as quickly the sky seemed to grow even darker
12,6,6,almost black
13,6,6,and rain poured down even more heavily than it had in the morning .

1,6,6,Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice
2,6,6,as she went hunting about
3,6,6,and called out to her in an angry tone
4,6,6,Why
5,6,6,Mary Ann
6,6,6,what ARE you doing out here
7,6,6,Run home this moment
8,6,6,and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan
9,6,6,Quick
10,6,6,now
11,6,6,' And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to
12,6,6,without trying to explain the mistake it had made He took me for his housemaid
13,3,3,' she said to herself as she ran How 3d he 'll be when he finds out who I am
14,6,6,But i 'd better take him his fan and gloves that is
15,6,6,if I can find them
16,6,6,As she said this
17,6,6,she came upon a neat little house
18,6,6,on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name  WRABBIT engraved upon it . She went in without knocking
19,6,6,and hurried upstairs
20,6,6,in great 4 lest she should meet the real Mary Ann
21,6,6,and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves

7,6,6,and hurried upstairs
8,4,4,in great 4 lest she should meet the real Mary Ann
9,6,6,and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves  How queer it seems
10,6,6,' Alice said to herself
11,6,6,to be going messages for a rabbit
12,6,6,I suppose Dinah'll be sending me on messages next
13,6,6,' And she began fancying the sort of thing that would happen :    "  Miss Alice
14,6,6,Come here directly
15,6,6,and get ready for your walk
16,6,6,"    "  Coming in a minute
17,6,6,nurse
18,6,6,But i 've got to see that the mouse does n't get out
19,6,6,Only I dont think
20,6,6,' Alice went on
21,6,6,that they 'd let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people
2051 34
 (19, 18),
1,6,6,Alas
2,6,6,it was too late to wish that
3,6,6,She went on growing
4,6,6,and growing
5,6,6,and very soon had to kneel down on the floor :  in another minute there was not even room for this
6,6,6,and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door
7,6,6,and the other arm curled round her head . Still she went on growing
8,6,6,and
9,6,6,as a last resource
10,6,6,she put one arm out of the window
11,6,6,and one foot up the chimney
12,6,6,and said to herself  Now I can do no more
13,6,6,whatever happens What WILL become of me
14,6,6,' Luckily for Alice
15,6,6,the little magic bottle had now had its full effect
16,6,6,and she grew no larger :  still it was very uncomfortable
17,6,6,and
18,6,1,as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again
19,1,unhappy,no wonder she felt unhappy  It was much more pleasant at home
20,6,6,' thought poor Alice
21,6,6,when one wasnt always growing larger and smaller
22,6,6,and being ordered about by mice and rabbits I almost wish I had not gone down that rabbit hole and yet and yet it 's rather curious
23,6,6,you know
24,6,6,this sort of life
25,6,6,I do wonder what CAN have happened to me
26,6,6,When I used to read fairy-tales
27,6,6,I fancied that kind of thing never happened
28,6,6,and now here I am in the middle of one
29,6,6,There ought to be a book written about me
30,6,6,that there ought
31,6,6,And when I grow up
32,6,6,i 'll write one but im grown-up now
33,6,6,' she added in a sorrowful tone
34,6,6,at least there 's no room to grow up any more HERE . '
2052 16
 (10, 10),
1,6,6,A barrow full of WHAT
2,6,6,' thought Alice
3,6,6,but she had not long to doubt
4,6,6,for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window
5,6,6,and some of them hit her in the face i 'll put a stop to this
6,6,6,' she said to herself
7,6,6,and shouted out
8,6,6,you 'd better not do that again
9,6,6,' which produced another dead silence
10,3,3,Alice noticed with some 3 that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor
11,6,6,and a bright idea came into her head If I eat one of these cakes
12,6,6,' she thought
13,6,6,it 's sure to make SOME change in my size
14,6,6,and as it cant possibly make me larger
15,6,6,it must make me smaller
16,6,6,I suppose . '
2053 30
 (7, 8),
1,6,6,An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes
2,6,6,and feebly stretching out one paw
3,6,6,trying to touch her Poor little thing
4,6,6,' said Alice
5,6,6,in a coaxing tone
6,6,6,and she tried hard to whistle to it
7,4,frightened,but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry
8,6,4,in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing Hardly knowing what she did
9,6,6,she picked up a little bit of stick
10,6,6,and held it out to the puppy
11,6,6,whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once
12,6,6,with a yelp of delight
13,6,6,and rushed at the stick
14,6,6,and made believe to worry it
15,6,6,then Alice dodged behind a great thistle
16,6,6,to keep herself from being run over
17,6,6,and the moment she appeared on the other side
18,6,6,the puppy made another rush at the stick
19,6,6,and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it
20,6,6,then Alice
21,6,6,thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart horse
22,6,6,and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet
23,6,6,ran round the thistle again
24,6,6,then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick
25,6,6,running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back
26,6,6,and barking hoarsely all the while
27,6,6,till at last it sat down a good way off
28,6,6,panting
29,6,6,with its tongue hanging out of its mouth
30,6,6,and its great eyes half shut .
2054 24
 (17, 17),
1,6,6,Well
2,6,6,perhaps you have n't found it so yet
3,6,6,' said Alice
4,6,6,but when you have to turn into a chrysalis you will some day
5,6,6,you know and then after that into a butterfly
6,6,6,I should think youll feel it a little queer
7,6,6,wont you
8,6,6,' Not a bit
9,6,6,' said the Caterpillar Well
10,6,6,perhaps your feelings may be different
11,6,6,' said Alice
12,6,6,all I know is
13,6,6,it would feel very queer to ME
14,6,6,You
15,6,6,' said the Caterpillar contemptuously Who are YOU
16,6,6,' Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation
17,5,5,ice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar 's making such VERY short remarks
18,6,6,and she drew herself up and said
19,6,6,very gravely
20,6,6,I think
21,6,6,you ought to tell me who YOU are
22,6,6,first
23,6,6,Why
24,6,6,' said the Caterpillar .
2055 37
 (18, 18),
1,6,6,Well
2,6,6,i 've tried to say  "  HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE
3,6,6,"   but it all came different
4,6,6,' Alice replied in a very melancholy voice
5,6,6,repeat
6,6,6,"  YOU ARE OLD
7,6,6,FATHER WILLIAM
8,6,6,"  ' said the Caterpillar  .  Alice folded her hands
9,6,6,and began :  You are old
10,6,6,Father William
11,6,6,' the young man said
12,6,6,And your hair has become very white
13,6,6,And yet you incessantly stand on your head  Do you think
14,6,6,at your age
15,6,6,it is right
16,6,6,'  In my youth
17,6,6,' Father William replied to his son
18,4,4,I 4ed it might injure the brain
19,6,6,But
20,6,6,now that im perfectly sure I have none
21,6,6,Why
22,6,6,I do it again and again
23,6,6,You are old
24,6,6,' said the youth
25,6,6,as I mentioned before
26,6,6,And have grown most uncommonly fat
27,6,6,Yet you turned a back somersault in at the door  Pray
28,6,6,what is the reason of that
29,6,6,'  In my youth
30,6,6,' said the sage
31,6,6,as he shook his grey locks
32,6,6,I kept all my limbs very supple By the use of this ointment one shilling the box  Allow me to sell you a couple
33,6,6,'  You are old
34,6,6,' said the youth
35,6,6,and your jaws are too weak For anything tougher than suet
36,6,6,Yet you finished the goose
37,6,6,with the bones and the beak  Pray how did you manage to do it
2056 23
 (10, 9),(10, 10),
1,6,6,Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute
2,6,6,trying to make out which were the two sides of it
3,6,6,and as it was perfectly round
4,6,6,she found this a very difficult question  .  However
5,6,6,at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go
6,6,6,and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand
7,6,6,nd now which is which
8,6,6,' she said to herself
9,6,4,and nibbled a little of the right-hand bit to try the effect :  the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin :  it had struck her foot
10,4,4,She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change
11,6,6,but she felt that there was no time to be lost
12,6,6,as she was shrinking rapidly
13,6,6,so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit . Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot
14,6,6,that there was hardly room to open her mouth
15,6,6,but she did it at last
16,6,6,and managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit Come
17,6,6,my head 's free at last
18,6,6,' said Alice in a tone of delight
19,6,6,which changed into alarm in another moment
20,6,6,when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found :  all she could see
21,6,6,when she looked down
22,6,6,was an immense length of neck
23,6,6,which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her
2057 37
 (24, 23),
1,6,6,Let me alone
2,6,6,'  Serpent
3,6,6,I say again
4,6,6,' repeated the Pigeon
5,6,6,but in a more subdued tone
6,6,6,and added with a kind of sob
7,6,6,i 've tried every way
8,6,6,and nothing seems to suit them
9,6,6,'  I have n't the least idea what you 're talking about
10,6,6,' said Alice
11,6,6,'ve tried the roots of trees
12,6,6,and i 've tried banks
13,6,6,and i 've tried hedges
14,6,6,' the Pigeon went on
15,6,6,without attending to her
16,6,6,but those serpents
17,6,6,There 's no pleasing them
18,6,6,' Alice was more and more puzzled
19,6,6,but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished As if it wasnt trouble enough hatching the eggs
20,6,6,' said the Pigeon
21,6,6,but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day
22,6,6,Why
23,6,2,I have n't had a wink of sleep these three weeks
24,2,annoyed,' im very sorry you 've been annoyed
25,6,6,' said Alice
26,6,6,who was beginning to see its meaning And just as i 'd taken the highest tree in the wood
27,6,6,' continued the Pigeon
28,6,6,raising its voice to a shriek
29,6,6,and just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last
30,6,6,they must needs come wriggling down from the sky
31,6,6,Ugh
32,6,6,Serpent
33,6,6,'  But im NOT a serpent
34,6,6,I tell you
35,6,6,' said Alice im a im a '  Well
36,6,6,WHAT are you
37,6,6,' said the Pigeon
2058 20
 (20, 20),
1,6,6,While she was trying to fix on one
2,6,6,the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire
3,6,6,and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby  the fire irons came first
4,6,6,then followed a shower of saucepans
5,6,6,plates
6,6,6,and dishes  .  The Duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her
7,6,6,and the baby was howling so much already
8,6,6,that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not
9,6,6,PLEASE mind what you 're doing
10,6,6,' cried Alice
11,6,6,jumping up and down in an agony of terror Oh
12,6,6,there goes his PRECIOUS nose '
13,6,6,as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it
14,6,6,and very nearly carried it off
15,6,6,f everybody minded their own business
16,6,6,' the Duchess said in a hoarse growl
17,6,6,the world would go round a deal faster than it does
18,6,6,Which would NOT be an advantage
19,6,6,' said Alice
20,0,0,who felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge
2059 29
 (14, 13),
1,6,6,Oh
2,6,6,there goes his PRECIOUS nose '
3,6,6,as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it
4,6,6,and very nearly carried it off
5,6,6,f everybody minded their own business
6,6,6,' the Duchess said in a hoarse growl
7,6,6,the world would go round a deal faster than it does
8,6,6,Which would NOT be an advantage
9,6,6,' said Alice
10,6,6,who felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge Just think of what work it would make with the day and night
11,6,6,You see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis ' Talking of axes
12,6,6,' said the Duchess
13,6,4,chop off her head
14,4,anxiously,' Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook
15,6,6,to see if she meant to take the hint
16,6,6,but the cook was busily stirring the soup
17,6,6,and seemed not to be listening
18,6,6,so she went on again :   Twenty-four hours
19,6,6,I THINK
20,6,6,or is it twelve
21,6,6,I ' Oh
22,6,6,dont bother ME
23,6,6,' said the Duchess
24,6,6,I never could abide figures
25,6,6,' And with that she began nursing her child again
26,6,6,singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so
27,6,6,and giving it a violent shake at the end of every line :   Speak roughly to your little boy
28,6,6,And beat him when he sneezes :  He only does it to annoy
29,6,6,Because he knows it teases . '
2060 18
 (5, 5),
1,6,6,I dont quite understand you
2,6,6,' she said
3,6,6,as politely as she could The Dormouse is asleep again
4,6,6,' said the Hatter
5,2,2,and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose  .  The Dormouse shook its head impatiently
6,6,6,and said
7,6,6,without opening its eyes
8,6,6,Of course
9,6,6,of course
10,6,6,just what I was going to remark myself
11,6,6,Have you guessed the riddle yet
12,6,6,' the Hatter said
13,6,6,turning to Alice again No
14,6,6,I give it up
15,6,6,' Alice replied :   what 's the answer
16,6,6,'  I have n't the slightest idea
17,6,6,' said the Hatter Nor I
18,6,6,' said the March Hare
2061 31
 (20, 12),(20, 13),(20, 18),
1,6,6,Would you tell me
2,6,6,' said Alice
3,6,6,a little timidly
4,6,6,why you are painting those roses
5,6,6,' Five and Seven said nothing
6,6,6,but looked at Two  .  Two began in a low voice
7,6,6,Why the fact is
8,6,6,you see
9,6,6,Miss
10,6,6,this here ought to have been a RED rose tree
11,6,6,and we put a white one in by mistake
12,6,4,and if the Queen was to find it out
13,6,4,we should all have our heads cut off
14,6,6,you know
15,6,6,you see
16,6,6,Miss
17,6,6,we 're doing our best
18,6,4,afore she comes
19,6,6,to ' At this moment Five
20,4,anxiously,who had been anxiously looking across the garden
21,6,6,called out  The Queen
22,6,6,The Queen
23,6,6,' and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces  .  There was a sound of many footsteps
24,6,6,and Alice looked round
25,6,6,eager to see the Queen  .  First came ten soldiers carrying clubs
26,6,6,these were all shaped like the three gardeners
27,6,6,oblong and flat
28,6,6,with their hands and feet at the corners :  next the ten courtiers
29,6,6,these were ornamented all over with diamonds
30,6,6,and walked two and two
31,6,6,as the soldiers did
2062 41
 (29, 29),
1,6,6,Idiot
2,6,6,' said the Queen
3,6,6,tossing her head impatiently
4,6,6,and
5,6,6,turning to Alice
6,6,6,she went on
7,6,6,What 's your name
8,6,6,child
9,6,6,'  My name is Alice
10,6,6,so please your Majesty
11,6,6,' said Alice very politely
12,6,6,but she added
13,6,6,to herself
14,6,6,Why
15,6,6,theyre only a pack of cards
16,6,6,after allI need n't be afraid of them
17,6,6,'  And who are THESE
18,6,6,' said the Queen
19,6,6,pointing to the three gardeners who were lying round the rose tree
20,6,6,for
21,6,6,you see
22,6,6,as they were lying on their faces
23,6,6,and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack
24,6,6,she could not tell whether they were gardeners
25,6,6,or soldiers
26,6,6,or courtiers
27,6,6,or three of her own children How should I know
28,6,6,' said Alice
29,3,3,3d at her own courage It 's no business of MINE
30,6,6,The Queen turned crimson with fury
31,6,6,and
32,6,6,after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast
33,6,6,screamed  Off with her head
34,6,6,Off '  Nonsense
35,6,6,' said Alice
36,6,6,very loudly and decidedly
37,6,6,and the Queen was silent  .  The King laid his hand upon her arm
38,6,6,and timidly said  Consider
39,6,6,my dear :  she is only a child
40,6,6,' The Queen turned angrily away from him
41,6,6,and said to the Knave  Turn them over
2063 18
 (4, 4),
1,6,6,I said  "  What for
2,6,6,"  '  She boxed the Queen 's ears ' the Rabbit began . Alice gave a little scream of laughter Oh
3,6,6,hush
4,4,4,' the Rabbit whispered in a frightened tone The Queen will hear you
5,6,6,You see
6,6,6,she came rather late
7,6,6,and the Queen said '  Get to your places
8,6,6,' shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder
9,6,6,and people began running about in all directions
10,6,6,tumbling up against each other
11,6,6,however
12,6,6,they got settled down in a minute or two
13,6,6,and the game began . Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet ground in her life
14,6,6,it was all ridges and furrows
15,6,6,the balls were live hedgehogs
16,6,6,the mallets live flamingoes
17,6,6,and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet
18,6,6,to make the arches
2064 19
 (9, 9),
1,6,6,By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back
2,6,6,the fight was over
3,6,6,and both the hedgehogs were out of sight :   but it does n't matter much
4,6,6,' thought Alice
5,6,6,as all the arches are gone from this side of the ground
6,6,6,So she tucked it away under her arm
7,6,6,that it might not escape again
8,6,6,and went back for a little more conversation with her friend  .  When she got back to the Cheshire Cat
9,3,3,she was 3d to find quite a large crowd collected round it :  there was a dispute going on between the executioner
10,6,6,the King
11,6,6,and the Queen
12,6,6,who were all talking at once
13,6,6,while all the rest were quite silent
14,6,6,and looked very uncomfortable The moment Alice appeared
15,6,6,she was appealed to by all three to settle the question
16,6,6,and they repeated their arguments to her
17,6,6,though
18,6,6,as they all spoke at once
19,6,6,she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said
2065 18
 (9, 10),(9, 13),
1,6,6,Thinking again
2,6,6,' the Duchess asked
3,6,6,with another dig of her sharp little chin i 've a right to think
4,6,6,' said Alice sharply
5,6,6,for she was beginning to feel a little worried Just about as much right
6,6,6,' said the Duchess
7,6,6,as pigs have to fly
8,6,6,and the m ' But here
9,3,to Alice 's great 3,to Alice 's great 3
10,6,3,the Duchess 's voice died away
11,6,6,even in the middle of her favourite word  moral
12,6,6,' and the arm that was linked into hers began to tremble . Alice looked up
13,6,3,and there stood the Queen in front of them
14,6,6,with her arms folded
15,6,6,frowning like a thunderstorm A fine day
16,6,6,your Majesty
17,6,6,' the Duchess began in a low
18,6,6,weak voice
2066 19
 (14, 8),(14, 9),
1,6,6,A fine day
2,6,6,your Majesty
3,6,6,' the Duchess began in a low
4,6,6,weak voice Now
5,6,6,I give you fair warning
6,6,6,' shouted the Queen
7,6,6,stamping on the ground as she spoke
8,6,4,either you or your head must be off
9,6,4,and that in about half no time
10,6,6,Take your choice
11,6,6,' The Duchess took her choice
12,6,6,and was gone in a moment Let 's go on with the game
13,6,6,' the Queen said to Alice
14,4,frightened,and Alice was too much frightened to say a word
15,6,6,but slowly followed her back to the croquet ground . The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen 's absence
16,6,6,and were resting in the shade :  however
17,6,6,the moment they saw her
18,6,6,they hurried back to the game
19,6,6,the Queen merely remarking that a moment 's delay would cost them their lives
2067 24
 (16, 16),
1,6,6,I dont even know what a Mock Turtle is
2,6,6,It 's the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from
3,6,6,' said the Queen I never saw one
4,6,6,or heard of one
5,6,6,' said Alice Come on
6,6,6,then
7,6,6,' said the Queen
8,6,6,and he shall tell you his history
9,6,6,' As they walked off together
10,6,6,Alice heard the King say in a low voice
11,6,6,to the company generally
12,6,6,You are all pardoned
13,6,6,Come
14,6,6,THAT 's a good thing
15,6,6,' she said to herself
16,1,1,for she had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered
17,6,6,ey very soon came upon a Gryphon
18,6,6,lying fast asleep in the sun ( IF you dont know what a Gryphon is
19,6,6,look at the picture
20,6,6,Up
21,6,6,lazy thing
22,6,6,' said the Queen
23,6,6,and take this young lady to see the Mock Turtle
24,6,6,and to hear his history
2068 20
 (9, 9),
1,6,6,When we were little
2,6,6,' the Mock Turtle went on at last
3,6,6,more calmly
4,6,6,though still sobbing a little now and then
5,6,6,we went to school in the sea . The master was an old Turtle we used to call him Tortoise '  Why did you call him Tortoise
6,6,6,if he wasnt one
7,6,6,' Alice asked We called him Tortoise because he taught us
8,6,6,' said the Mock Turtle angrily :   really you are very dull
9,1,1,'  You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question
10,6,6,' added the Gryphon
11,6,6,and then they both sat silent and looked at poor Alice
12,6,6,who felt ready to sink into the earth . At last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle
13,6,6,Drive on
14,6,6,old fellow
15,6,6,dont be all day about it
16,6,6,' and he went on in these words :   Yes
17,6,6,we went to school in the sea
18,6,6,though you may n't believe it '  I never said I didnt
19,6,6,' interrupted Alice You did
20,6,6,' said the Mock Turtle
2069 26
 (19, 17),
1,6,6,theyre done with blacking
2,6,6,I believe
3,6,6,Boots and shoes under the sea
4,6,6,' the Gryphon went on in a deep voice
5,6,6,are done with a whiting . Now you know
6,6,6,And what are they made of
7,6,6,' Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity Soles and eels
8,6,6,of course
9,6,6,' the Gryphon replied rather impatiently :   any shrimp could have told you that
10,6,6,If i 'd been the whiting
11,6,6,' said Alice
12,6,6,whose thoughts were still running on the song
13,6,6,i 'd have said to the porpoise
14,6,6,"  Keep back
15,6,6,please :  we dont want YOU with us
16,6,6,"  '  They were obliged to have him with them
17,6,3,' the Mock Turtle said :   no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise
18,6,6,would n't it really
19,3,in a tone of great 3,' said Alice in a tone of great 3 Of course not
20,6,6,' said the Mock Turtle :   why
21,6,6,if a fish came to ME
22,6,6,and told me he was going a journey
23,6,6,I should say  "  With what porpoise
24,6,6,"  '  dont you mean  "  purpose "
25,6,6,' said Alice I mean what I say
26,6,6,' the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone
2070 23
 (11, 11),
1,6,6,And the Gryphon added  Come
2,6,6,let 's hear some of YOUR adventures
3,6,6,I could tell you my adventures beginning from this morning
4,6,6,' said Alice a little timidly :   but it 's no use going back to yesterday
5,6,6,because I was a different person then
6,6,6,Explain all that
7,6,6,' said the Mock Turtle No
8,6,6,no
9,6,6,The adventures first
10,6,6,' said the Gryphon in an impatient tone :   explanations take such a dreadful time
11,4,4,So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the White Rabbit She was a little nervous about it just at first
12,6,6,the two creatures got so close to her
13,6,6,one on each side
14,6,6,and opened their eyes and mouths so VERY wide
15,6,6,but she gained courage as she went on . Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about her repeating  YOU ARE OLD
16,6,6,FATHER WILLIAM
17,6,6,' to the Caterpillar
18,6,6,and the words all coming different
19,6,6,and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath
20,6,6,and said  That 's very curious
21,6,6,It 's all about as curious as it can be
22,6,6,' said the Gryphon It all came different
23,6,6,' the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully
2071 28
 (8, 6),(8, 7),
1,6,6,Off with her head
2,6,6,' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice . Nobody moved Who cares for you
3,6,6,' said Alice
4,6,6,( she had grown to her full size by this time
5,6,6,you 're nothing but a pack of cards
6,6,4,' At this the whole pack rose up into the air
7,6,4,and came flying down upon her :  she gave a little scream
8,4,half of fright and half of 5,half of fright and half of 5
9,6,6,and tried to beat them off
10,6,6,and found herself lying on the bank
11,6,6,with her head in the lap of her sister
12,6,6,who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face Wake up
13,6,6,Alice dear
14,6,6,' said her sister
15,6,6,Why
16,6,6,what a long sleep you 've had
17,6,6,'  Oh
18,6,6,i 've had such a curious dream
19,6,6,' said Alice
20,6,6,and she told her sister
21,6,6,as well as she could remember them
22,6,6,all these strange Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about
23,6,6,and when she had finished
24,6,6,her sister kissed her
25,6,6,and said
26,6,6,It WAS a curious dream
27,6,6,dear
28,6,6,certainly :  but now run in to your tea
2073 12
 (2, 2),
1,6,6,Patrick 's face cleared
2,4,4,It was no grace or beauty that he 4ed in any str5
3,6,6,but the sheer might and un right that their Regency enabled the House of Albany to exercise over the orphans of the royal family
4,6,6,whose head was absent
5,6,6,and a captive knight could be no mischievous person
6,6,6,Still this might be only a specious pretence to impose on the chaplain
7,6,6,and gain admittance to the castle
8,6,6,and Patrick was resolved to be well on his guard
9,6,6,though he replied courteously to the graceful bow with which the str5 greeted him
10,6,6,saying in a manly mellow voice and southern accent
11,6,6,' i have been bold enough to presume on the good father 's offer of hospitality
12,6,6,Sir . '
2074 4
 (4, 4),
1,6,6,' what should I see
2,6,6,Who is he like
3,6,6,' asked Patrick
4,3,3,3d at his father 's manner .
2075 13
 (2, 1),
1,6,2,Lilias sat between her uncle and his guest
2,2,jealousy,looking so fair and bright that Patrick felt fresh accesses of angry jealousy
3,6,6,while the visitor talked as one able to report to the natives from another world
4,6,6,and that world the hateful England
5,6,6,which as a Scotsman he was bound to abhor
6,6,6,Had it been France
7,6,6,it had been endurable
8,6,6,but praise of English habits was mere disloyalty
9,6,6,and yet
10,6,6,whenever Patrick tried to throw in a disparaging word
11,6,6,he found himself met with a quiet superiority such as he had believed no knight in Scotland could assume with him
12,6,6,and still it was neither brow beating nor insolence
13,6,6,nothing that could give offence .
2076 12
 (2, 2),
1,6,6,Patrick shrugged his shoulders
2,4,4,but Lilias was so anxious to hear the lay
3,6,6,that she entreated him to be silent
4,6,6,and Sir James
5,6,6,with a manly mellow voice
6,6,6,with an exceedingly sweet strain in it
7,6,6,and a skill
8,6,6,both of modulation and finger
9,6,6,such as showed admirable taste and instruction
10,6,6,poured forth that beautiful song of the nightingale at Windsor
11,6,6,which commences King James 's story of his love
12,6,6,in his poem of the King 's Quhair .
2077 23
 (12, 12),
1,6,6,There was an eager pressing round to hear
2,6,6,and not only were Lilias and Malcolm
3,6,6,but old Sir David himself
4,6,6,much affected by the strain
5,6,6,which the latter said put him in mind of the days of King Robert III
6,6,6,which
7,6,6,sad as they were
8,6,6,now seemed like good old times
9,6,6,so much worse was the present state of affairs
10,6,6,Sir James
11,6,6,however
12,4,4,seemed anxious to prevent discussion of the verses he had sung
13,6,6,and applied to Malcolm to give a specimen of his powers :   and thus
14,6,6,with music
15,6,6,ballad
16,6,6,and lay
17,6,6,the evening passed away
18,6,6,till the parting cup was sent round
19,6,6,and the Tutor of Glenuskie and Malcolm marshalled their guest to the apartment where he was to sleep
20,6,6,in a wainscoted box bedstead
21,6,6,and his two attendant squires
22,6,6,a great iron gray Scot and a rosy honest faced Englishman
23,6,6,on pallets on the floor .
2078 29
 (22, 22),
1,6,6,They were
2,6,6,in effect
3,6,6,riding somewhat carelessly
4,6,6,and with the ease of men whose feat was performed
5,6,6,and who expected no more opposition Full in the midst was Lilias
6,6,6,entirely muffled and pinioned by a large plaid drawn closely round her
7,6,6,and held upon the front of the saddle of a large tall horse
8,6,6,ridden by a slender
9,6,6,light limbed
10,6,6,wiry groom
11,6,6,whom Malcolm knew as Christopher Hall
12,6,6,a retainer of the Duke of Albany
13,6,6,and beside him rode her captor
14,6,6,Sir Walter Stewart
15,6,6,a man little above twenty
16,6,6,but with a bronzed
17,6,6,hardened
18,6,6,reckless expression that made him look much older
19,6,6,and of huge height and giant build . Malcolm knew him well
20,6,6,and regarded him with unmitigated horror and dread
21,6,6,both from the knowledge of his ruffianly violence even towards his father
22,4,4,from 4 of his intentions
23,6,6,and from the misery that his brutal jests
24,6,6,scoffs
25,6,6,and practical jokes had often personally inflicted :   and the sight of his sister in the power of this wicked man was the realization of all his worst 4s But ere there was time for more than one strong pang of consternation and constitutional terror
26,6,6,Sir James 's shout of  ' st andrew for the right
27,6,6,' was ringing out
28,6,6,echoed by all the fifteen in ambush with him
29,6,6,as simultaneously they leapt forward
2079 2
 (1, 1),
1,4,4,And for all Malcolm 's anxiety for his uncle
2,6,6,his heart had never given such a leap as at finding himself suddenly raised from the depressed down-trodden coward into something like manhood and self respect .
2080 27
 (25, 26),(25, 27),
1,6,6,' kinsman
2,6,6,' thought Malcolm
3,6,6,' do all wandering Stewarts claim kin to the blood royal
4,6,6,' but then
5,6,6,as he looked at Sir James 's stately head
6,6,6,he felt that no assumption could be unbecoming in one of such a presence
7,6,6,and so kind to himself
8,6,6,and
9,6,6,ashamed of the moment 's petulance
10,6,6,dismounted
11,6,6,and
12,6,6,as John said
13,6,6,' this is the way to our noon meat
14,6,6,' he let himself be conducted through the trees to a glade
15,6,6,sheltered from the wind
16,6,6,where a Lenten though not unsavoury meal of bread
17,6,6,dried fish
18,6,6,and eggs was laid out on the grass
19,6,6,in a bright warm sunshine
20,6,6,and Hal
21,6,6,declaring himself to have a hunter 's appetite
22,6,6,and that he knew Jamie had been starved in Scotland
23,6,6,and was as lean as a greyhound
24,6,6,seated himself on the grass
25,3,3,and to Malcolm 's extreme 3
26,6,3,not to say 2
27,6,3,was served by Lord Marmion on the knee and with doffed cap .
2081 13
 (12, 12),
1,6,6,He was glad that his own Sir James was equal in dignity
2,6,6,as well as superior in height
3,6,6,and he thought the terrible red lightning of those auburn eyes would be impossible to the sparkling azure eyes of the Englishman
4,6,6,steadfast
5,6,6,keen
6,6,6,and brilliant unspeakably though they were
7,6,6,but so soon as Sir James seemed to have made his explanation
8,6,6,the look was most winningly turned on him
9,6,6,a hand held out
10,6,6,and he was thus greeted :   ' welcome
11,6,6,my young Prince Malcolm
12,0,0,I am happy that your cousin thinks so well of our cheer
13,6,6,that he has brought you to partake it . '
2082 20
 (20, 19),
1,6,6,A courier rode up at the moment
2,6,6,and presented some letters
3,6,6,which Sir Harry at once opened and read
4,6,6,beckoning his brother and Sir James to his side
5,6,6,while Malcolm rode on in their wake
6,6,6,in a state of dismay and bewilderment
7,6,6,Nigel and Lord Marmion were together at so great an interval that he could not fall back on them
8,6,6,nor learn from them who these brothers were
9,6,6,And there was something in the ironical suppressed pity with which Harry had spoken of his prospects with the King of Scots
10,6,6,that terrified him all the more
11,6,6,because he knew that Sir James and Nigel would both hold it unworthy of him to have spoken freely of his own sovereign with an Englishman
12,6,6,Would James be another Walter
13,6,6,and
14,6,6,if so
15,6,6,would Sir James Stewart protect him
16,6,6,He had acquired much affection for
17,6,6,and strong reliance on
18,6,6,the knight
19,6,1,but there was something unexplained
20,1,hear sank,and his hear sank .

2084 6

1,6,6,' would Douglas but so fight in any good quarrel

3,6,6,' but what are you longing to ask

1,6,6,Malcolm
2,6,6,ashamed to say he was royal
3,3,3,but 3d at the patronage

 (7, 7),
1,6,6,Malcolm felt as averse as did the French princesses to burgher wealth and splendour
2,6,6,and his mind had not opened to understand burgher worth and weight
3,6,6,and when he saw the princes John and Humfrey
4,6,6,and even his own king
5,6,6,seeking out city dames and accosting them with friendly looks
6,6,6,it seemed to him a degrading truckling to riches
7,4,4,from which he was anxious to save his future queen
8,6,6,but when he would have offered his arm to Lady Joan
9,6,6,he saw her already being led away by an alderman measuring at least a yard across the shoulders
10,6,6,and the good natured Earl of March
11,6,6,seeing him at a loss
12,6,6,presented him to a round merry wife in a scarlet petticoat and black boddice
13,6,6,its plump curves wreathed with geld chains
14,6,6,who began pitying him for having been sent to the wars so young
15,6,6,being
16,6,6,as usual
17,6,6,charmed into pity by his soft appealing eyes and unconscious grace
18,6,6,would not believe his assertions that he was neither a captive nor a Frenchman
19,6,6,dont tell her
20,6,6,when he spoke like a str5
21,6,6,and halted from a wound . '

2,6,6,had almost lost his lameness
3,6,6,and gained much more appearance of health and power of enduring fatigue
4,6,6,His nerves had become less painfully sensitive
5,6,6,and when after his first skirmish
6,6,6,during which he had kept close to King James
7,6,6,far too much terrified to stir an inch from him
8,6,6,he had not only found himself perfectly safe
9,6,6,but had been much praised for his valour
10,6,6,he had been so much pleased with himself that he quite wished for another occasion of displaying his bravery
11,6,6,and
12,6,6,what with use
13,6,6,and what with the increasing spirit of pugnacity
14,6,6,he was as sincere as Ralf Percy in abusing the French for never coming to a pitched battle
15,6,6,Perhaps
16,6,6,indeed
17,6,6,Malcolm spoke even more eagerly than Ralf
18,6,6,in his own 3 and gratification at finding himself no coward
19,4,4,and his 4 lest Percy should detect that he ever had been supposed to be such .

10,6,6,he had been so much pleased with himself that he quite wished for another occasion of displaying his bravery
11,6,6,and
12,6,6,what with use
13,6,6,and what with the increasing spirit of pugnacity
14,6,6,he was as sincere as Ralf Percy in abusing the French for never coming to a pitched battle
15,6,6,Perhaps
16,6,6,indeed
17,6,6,Malcolm spoke even more eagerly than Ralf
18,3,3,in his own 3 and gratification at finding himself no coward
19,6,6,and his 4 lest Percy should detect that he ever had been supposed to be such .
2095 16
 (5, 5),
1,6,6,Blows hailed thick on the door
2,6,6,a flaming torch was handed over the heads of the throng
3,6,6,horrible growls and roars pervaded them
4,6,6,Malcolm and Ralf
5,5,5,furious at the cheat
6,6,6,stood among the foremost
7,6,6,making so much noise themselves between thundering and reviling
8,6,6,and calling out
9,6,6,' where are the Armagnacs
10,6,6,Down with the traitors
11,6,6,' that they were not aware of a sudden hush behind them
12,6,6,till a buffet from a heavy hand fell on Malcolm 's shoulder
13,6,6,and a mighty voice cried  ' shame
14,6,6,shame
15,6,6,What
16,6,6,you too
2097 7
 (2, 2),
1,6,6,Would she be there
2,4,4,That was the chief anxiety :   for it was not certain that either she or her mistress would risk themselves on the Continent
3,6,6,and Catherine had given no intimation as to who would be in her suite so that
4,6,6,as Henry had merrily observed
5,6,6,he was the only one in the whole party who was not in suspense
6,6,6,except indeed Salisbury
7,6,6,who had sent his commands to his little daughter to come out with the Queen .
2098 8
 (3, 3),(3, 4),
1,6,6,James smiled and coloured with pleasure
2,6,6,the fantastic message was not devoid of reality in the days when young imaginative spirits tried to hide the prose of war and policy in a bright mist of romantic fancy
3,1,1,nor was he ashamed to bend his manly head in reverence to
4,6,1,and even press to his lips
5,6,6,his lady 's first love letter
6,6,6,in the very sight of the satirical though sympathizing Bedford
7,6,6,of whom he eagerly asked of the fair Joan 's health and welfare
8,6,6,and whether she were flouted by Queen Catherine .

1,6,6,"  The right of parents is with those that have done the duty of parents

6,6,2,for not better loving your own niece  .  "
2110 24
 (12, 12),
1,6,6,Here were the malicious defraud ers of the hungry warriors
2,6,6,Down upon them flew the angry foragers
3,6,6,Soon the pretty tranquil scene was ringing with the oaths of the plundering and the cries of the plundered
4,6,6,the cattle were being driven off
5,6,6,the houses and farm yards rifled
6,6,6,blood was flowing
7,6,6,and what could not be carried off was burning
8,6,6,The search for the Armagnac prisoner had
9,6,6,however
10,6,6,relaxed after the first inquiry
11,6,6,and Malcolm
12,3,3,3d that this had been forgotten
13,6,6,suddenly bethought him of the distinction he should secure by sending a valuable prize to Esclairmonde 's feet
14,6,6,He seized on an old man who had not been able to fly
15,6,6,and stood trembling and panting in a corner
16,6,6,and demanded where the sick man was
17,6,6,The old man pointed to a farmhouse
18,6,6,round which clouds of smoke were rolling
19,6,6,and Malcolm hurried into it
20,6,6,shouting
21,6,6,' dog of an Armagnac
22,6,6,come out
23,6,6,Yield
24,6,6,ere thou be burnt
2111 16
 (6, 6),
1,6,6,Meantime James hurriedly explained to Kitson that here was the sick man left by the enemy
2,6,6,summoned Sir Nigel to his side
3,6,6,closed his own visor
4,6,6,and called for water
5,6,6,then hung over the prisoner
6,4,4,anxious to prevent the first word from being broad Scotch
7,6,6,In the free air
8,6,6,some long sobs showed that Patrick was struggling back to life
9,6,6,and James at once said
10,6,6,' rendez vous
11,6,6,My Lord
12,6,6,' but he neither answered
13,6,6,nor was there meaning in his eyes
14,6,6,And James perceived that he was bandaged as though for broken ribs
15,6,6,and that his right shoulder was dislocated
16,6,6,and no doubt had been a second time pulled out when Malcolm had grasped him by the arms .

15,6,6,and that his right shoulder was dislocated
16,6,6,and no doubt had been a second time pulled out when Malcolm had grasped him by the arms
17,6,6,He swooned again at the first attempt to lift him
18,6,6,and a hay cart having been left in the flight of the marauders
19,6,6,he was laid in it
20,6,6,and covered with the King 's cloak
21,6,6,to be conveyed to Corbeil
22,6,6,where James trusted to secure his life by personal intercession with Henry
23,6,6,He groaned heavily several times
24,6,6,but never opened his eyes or spoke articulately the whole way
25,6,6,and James and Sir Nigel kept on either side of the cart
26,6,6,ready to address him in French the first moment
27,6,6,having told the English that he was a prisoner of quality
28,6,6,who must be carefully conveyed to King James 's tent at Corbeil
29,6,1,Malcolm was not allowed to approach
30,6,1,lest he should be recognized
31,1,in an agony of shame and suspense,and he rode along in an agony of shame and suspense
32,6,6,with very different feelings towards Patrick than those with which he had of late thought of him
33,6,6,or of his own promises
34,6,6,If Patrick died through this plundering raid
35,6,6,how should he ever face Lily
2113 11
 (4, 4),
1,6,6,Nothing had passed about Patrick Drummond
2,6,6,nor the high words of last night
3,6,6,Henry seemed to have forgotten them
4,4,4,between his bodily suffering and the anxiety of being forced to relinquish the command just before a battle
5,6,6,and James would have felt it ungenerous to harass him at such a moment
6,6,6,when absolutely committed to his charge
7,6,6,For the present
8,6,6,there was no 4 of the prisoner being summarily executed by any lawful authority
9,6,6,since the King had promised to take cognizance of the case
10,6,6,and the chief d5 was from his chance discovery by some lawless man-at-arms
11,6,6,who would think himself doing good service by killing a concealed Scot under any circumstances .
2114 26
 (12, 12),
1,6,6,Patrick 's life was granted
2,6,6,although it had been promised too late to send the intelligence back to the tent at Corbeil
3,6,6,So far
4,6,6,the purpose of his vow to St
5,6,6,Andrew had been accomplished
6,6,6,but with the probability that he should soon again be associated with Patrick
7,6,6,came the sense of the failure in purpose and in promise
8,6,6,Patrick would not reproach him
9,6,6,he well knew nay
10,6,6,would rejoice in the change
11,6,6,but even this certainty galled him
12,1,1,and made him dread his cousin 's presence as likely to bring him a sense of shame
13,6,6,What would Patrick think of his letting a lady be absolutely compelled to marry him
14,6,6,Might he not say it was the part of Walter Stewart over again
15,6,6,Indeed
16,6,6,Malcolm remembered how carefully King James was prevented from hearing the means by which the Countess intended to make the lady his own
17,6,6,and a sensation came over him
18,6,6,that it was profanation to call on St
19,6,6,Andrew to bless what was to be brought about by such means
20,6,6,Why was it that
21,6,6,as his eyes fell on the face of King Henry
22,6,6,the whole world and all his projects acquired so different a colouring
23,6,6,and a sentence he had once heard Esclairmonde quote would come to him constantly :   ' my son
24,6,6,think not to buy off God
25,6,6,It is thyself that He requires
26,6,6,not thy gifts . '

2,6,6,When she had a little recovered the shock of so  bitter a reception
3,6,6,she wiped away her tears to prevent the additional  stab that the knowledge of it would give to Hippolita
4,4,4,who questioned  her in the most anxious terms on the health of Manfred
5,6,4,and how he  bore his loss
6,6,6,Matilda assured her he was well
7,6,6,and supported his  misfortune with manly fortitude .

4,6,6,that inspires me with this - I know not what to call it
5,6,6,As she never  acts from caprice
6,6,6,I am sure there is some fatal secret at bottom -  nay
7,1,1,I know there is :   in her agony of grief for my brother 's death  she dropped some words that intimated as much .  "

6,6,1,with Marty sometimes crying and shaking .
2156 4
 (1, 1),(1, 4),
1,4,4,She was also disturbed by how filled with hatred Joel seemed at times
2,6,6,such as the night a couple of months earlier when he had said to Mariel
3,6,6," Were big enough now
4,6,4,lets plan a way to kill Dad
2157 7
 (7, 5),
1,6,6,A couple of weeks later
2,6,6,he had said to her
3,6,6," I mean it Mariel
4,6,6,if he makes Mom cry one more time
5,6,4,I am going to beat his brains in with my baseball bat while hes sleeping
6,6,6,Marty had overheard what Joel said
7,4,have violent nightmares,and started to have violent nightmares .
2158 6
 (2, 1),
1,6,2,One night Mariel woke up out of her sleep to hear her parents fighting in their bedroom
2,2,sick," Im sick of this
3,6,6,Kaleigh
4,6,6,"  her father was yelling
5,6,6," its been weeks
6,6,6,I dont want to hear any more of your fucking excuses about how your head aches or youre too tired .
2159 20

10,6,6,Id better not find you here
11,6,6,or youll be sorry
12,6,6,You can go sleep under a bridge for all I care
13,6,4,Mariel could then hear drawers opening and slamming
14,6,4,and the sound of glass smashing
15,6,4,followed by her fathers car screeching out of the driveway
16,6,6,She quickly went to comfort her brothers
17,4,pale and trembling,and she found Marty pale and trembling
18,6,6,Her mother did not come out of her room
19,6,6,Mariel stayed with Joel and Marty and eventually fell asleep in Martys bed with him
20,6,6,drifting off into a night of haunted dreams that left her drained and pale .

4,6,6," We need some time apart to work things out so that we wont fight so much
5,6,1,They wanted to know how long Dad would be away
6,6,1,but she had to tell them that she didnt really know

5,6,6," I hope we never see him again

 (2, 2),(2, 3),
1,6,6,But 0 began to have its price

2167 7
 (4, 6),(4, 7),

5,6,6,and would tell friends and relatives

7,6,1,She has brainwashed the children to think everything is my fault
2168 6
 (6, 6),
1,6,6,Joel made a point of saying to Mariel
2,6,6,and to his mother
3,6,6," Who cares if he calls
4,6,6,He should go to hell
5,6,6,But in reality he felt abandoned by his father
6,1,1,and worried that maybe Dad hated him for taking his mothers side .
2169 5
 (4, 1),
1,6,0,With Felix out of the house
2,6,6,Mariels relationship with her mother became better in some ways and more difficult in others
3,6,6,Mom was noticeably more patient and less grouchy
4,0,smile and laugh sometimes,She would even smile and laugh sometimes
5,6,6,and the attention she paid the children was more focused than they could remember in many years .
2171 4
 (4, 2),(4, 4),
1,6,6,She didnt want her mother to have a kind of authority that Mariel wasnt used to
2,6,1,and she felt somewhat pushed away emotionally

1,6,6,After two or three months had gone by
2,6,6,the relaxed and cooperative atmosphere in the home began to deteriorate
3,4,4,The childrens complicated and often contradictory emotions about their parents separation began to erupt in various ways .
2174 4
 (4, 3),
1,6,6,This backlog of distress was now tightly interwoven with their upset and guilt about the recent changes
2,6,6,And now that Dad wasnt in the home anymore
3,6,0,and with Mom visibly stronger and happier
4,0,safe,the children felt safe to let loose demons they had been keeping tightly caged .

 (8, 9),
1,6,6,Mariel

14,6,5,if I were to hear anybody speak slightingly of you
15,5,fire up,I should fire up in a moment :  but that is not at all likely

9,6,6,I thought it had not been readable
10,6,6,But
11,6,6,my dearest Catherine

3,6,6,of admiring the set of her gown
4,6,6,and envying the curl of her hair
5,6,6,they followed their chaperones
6,6,6,arm in arm

1,6,6,Catherine accepted this kindness with gratitude
2,6,6,and they continued as they were for three minutes longer

4,6,6,who had been talking to James on the other side of her
5,6,6,turned again to his sister and whispered

5,6,6,between whom she now remained
6,5,5,She could not help being vexed at the non-appearance of Mr Thorpe
7,6,6,for she not only longed to be dancing
8,6,6,but was likewise aware that
9,6,6,as the real dignity of her situation could not be known
10,6,6,she was sharing with the scores of other young ladies still sitting down all the discredit of wanting a partner .

8,6,6,within three yards of the place where they sat
9,6,6,he seemed to be moving that way

11,6,6,and therefore the smile and the blush
12,6,6,which his sudden reappearance raised in Catherine

5,6,6,by seeing
6,6,6,not Mr Thorpe
7,6,6,but Mr Tilney
8,6,6,within three yards of the place where they sat
9,6,6,he seemed to be moving that way
10,6,6,but he did not see her
11,0,smile,and therefore the smile and the blush
12,6,0,which his sudden reappearance raised in Catherine
13,6,6,passed away without sullying her heroic importance .
2435 19
 (15, 14),
1,6,6,Mr Tilney and his companion
2,6,6,who continued
3,6,6,though slowly
4,6,6,to approach
5,6,6,were immediately preceded by a lady
6,6,6,an acquaintance of Mrs
7,6,6,Thorpe
8,6,6,and this lady stopping to speak to her
9,6,6,they
10,6,6,as belonging to her
11,6,6,stopped likewise
12,6,6,and Catherine
13,6,6,catching Mr Tilney 's eye
14,6,0,instantly received from him the smiling tribute of recognition
15,0,pleasure,She returned it with pleasure
16,6,6,and then advancing still nearer
17,6,6,he spoke both to her and Mrs
18,6,6,Allen
19,6,6,by whom he was very civilly acknowledged .
2436 26
 (25, 13),
1,6,6,"  I tell you
2,6,6,Mr Morland
3,6,6,"   she cried
4,6,6,"  I would not do such a thing for all the world
5,6,6,How can you be so teasing
6,6,6,only conceive
7,6,6,my dear Catherine
8,6,6,what your brother wants me to do
9,6,6,He wants me to dance with him again
10,6,6,though I tell him that it is a most improper thing
11,6,6,and entirely against the rules
12,6,6,It would make us the talk of the place
13,6,3,if we were not to change partners
14,6,6,"  Upon my honour
15,6,6,"   said James
16,6,6,"  in these public assemblies
17,6,6,it is as often done as not
18,6,6,"  Nonsense
19,6,6,how can you say so
20,6,6,But when you men have a point to carry
21,6,6,you never stick at anything
22,6,6,My sweet Catherine
23,6,6,do support me
24,6,6,persuade your brother how impossible it is
25,3,shock,Tell him that it would quite shock you to see me do such a thing
26,6,6,now would not it
2437 25
 (25, 2),(25, 3),
1,6,6,"  Ah
2,6,1,He has got a partner
3,6,1,I wish he had asked you
4,6,6,"   said Mrs
5,6,6,Allen
6,6,6,and after a short silence
7,6,6,she added
8,6,6,"  he is a very agreeable young man
9,6,6,"  Indeed he is
10,6,6,Mrs
11,6,6,Allen
12,6,6,"   said Mrs
13,6,6,Thorpe
14,6,6,smiling complacently
15,6,6,"  I must say it
16,6,6,though I am his mother
17,6,6,that there is not a more agreeable young man in the world
18,6,6,This inapplicable answer might have been too much for the comprehension of many
19,6,6,but it did not puzzle Mrs
20,6,6,Allen
21,6,6,for after only a moment 's consideration
22,6,6,she said
23,6,6,in a whisper to Catherine
24,6,6,"  I dare say she thought I was speaking of her son
25,1,disappointed,Catherine was disappointed and vexed .
2438 25
 (25, 2),(25, 3),
1,6,6,"  Ah
2,6,5,He has got a partner
3,6,5,I wish he had asked you
4,6,6,"   said Mrs
5,6,6,Allen
6,6,6,and after a short silence
7,6,6,she added
8,6,6,"  he is a very agreeable young man
9,6,6,"  Indeed he is
10,6,6,Mrs
11,6,6,Allen
12,6,6,"   said Mrs
13,6,6,Thorpe
14,6,6,smiling complacently
15,6,6,"  I must say it
16,6,6,though I am his mother

2439 13
 (1, 5),
1,4,frightened,"  You will not be frightened
2,6,6,Miss Morland
3,6,6,"   said Thorpe
4,6,6,as he handed her in
5,6,4,"  if my horse should dance about a little at first setting off
6,6,6,He will
7,6,6,most likely
8,6,6,give a plunge or two
9,6,6,and perhaps take the rest for a minute
10,6,6,but he will soon know his master
11,6,6,He is full of spirits
12,6,6,playful as can be
13,6,6,but there is no vice in him .  "
2443 7
 (3, 4),
1,6,6,When they arrived at Mrs
2,6,6,Allen 's door
3,3,astonishment,the astonishment of Isabella was hardly to be expressed
4,6,3,on finding that it was too late in the day for them to attend her friend into the house :   "  Past three o'clock
5,6,6,"   It was inconceivable
6,6,6,incredible
7,6,6,impossible
2444 16
 (15, 15),
1,6,6,And she would neither believe her own watch
2,6,6,nor her brother 's
3,6,6,nor the servant 's
4,6,6,she would believe no assurance of it founded on reason or reality
5,6,6,till Morland produced his watch
6,6,6,and ascertained the fact
7,6,6,to have doubted a moment longer then would have been equally inconceivable
8,6,6,incredible
9,6,6,and impossible
10,6,6,and she could only protest
11,6,6,over and over again
12,6,6,that no two hours and a half had ever gone off so swiftly before
13,6,6,as Catherine was called on to confirm
14,6,6,Catherine could not tell a falsehood even to please Isabella
15,1,1,but the latter was spared the misery of her friend 's dissenting voice
16,6,6,by not waiting for her answer .
2449 3
 (3, 3),
1,6,6,Catherine 's resolution of endeavouring to meet Miss Tilney again continued in full force the next morning
2,6,6,and till the usual moment of going to the pump room
3,4,4,she felt some alarm from the dread of a second prevention .
2450 7
 (3, 3),
1,6,6,At length however she was empowered to disengage herself from her friend
2,6,6,by the avowed necessity of speaking to Miss Tilney
3,0,0,whom she most joyfully saw just entering the room with Mrs Hughes
4,6,6,and whom she instantly joined
5,6,6,with a firmer determination to be acquainted
6,6,6,than she might have had courage to command
7,6,6,had she not been urged by the disappointment of the day before .
2451 9
 (2, 2),
1,6,6,She entered the rooms on Thursday evening with feelings very different from what had attended her thither the Monday before
2,0,0,She had then been exulting in her engagement to Thorpe
3,6,6,and was now chiefly anxious to avoid his sight
4,6,6,lest he should engage her again
5,6,6,for though she could not
6,6,6,dared not expect that Mr Tilney should ask her a third time to dance
7,6,6,her wishes
8,6,6,hopes
9,6,6,and plans all centred in nothing less .

 (20, 12),
1,6,6,"  Well
2,6,6,tuck in
3,6,6,"   said Fledge
4,6,6,taking a big mouthful of grass
5,6,6,Then he raised his head
6,6,6,still chewing and with bits of grass sticking out on each side of his mouth like whiskers
7,6,6,and said
8,6,6,"  Come on
9,6,6,you two
10,6,6,dont be shy
11,6,6,There 's plenty for us all
12,6,1,"  But we cant eat grass
13,6,6,"   said Digory
14,6,6,"  Hmm
15,6,6,hmm
16,6,6,"   said Fledge
17,6,6,speaking with his mouth full
18,6,6,"  Well - hmm - dont know quite what youll do then
19,6,6,Very good grass too
20,1,stared at one another in dismay,Polly and Digory stared at one another in dismay .
2464 13
 (12, 13),
1,6,6,A Panther
2,6,6,which had been washing its face
3,6,6,stopped for a moment to say
4,6,6,"  Well
5,6,6,if they are
6,6,6,theyre nothing like so good as the first one
7,6,6,At least
8,6,6,1 dont see anything very funny about them
9,6,6,It yawned and went on with its wash
10,6,6,please
11,6,6,"   said Digory
12,4,in such a hurry,"  im in such a hurry
13,6,4,I want to see the Lion .  "
2479 14
 (5, 4),(5, 5),
1,6,6,Mr Darcy corroborated it with a bow
2,6,6,and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth
3,6,6,when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the str5
4,6,3,and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other
5,3,3,was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting
6,6,6,Both changed colour
7,6,6,one looked white
8,6,6,the other red
9,6,6,Mr Wickham
10,6,6,after a few moments
11,6,6,touched his hat   a salutation which Mr Darcy just deigned to return
12,6,6,What could be the meaning of it
13,6,6,It was impossible to imagine
14,6,6,it was impossible not to long to know .
2480 6
 (5, 6),
1,6,6,Mr Denny addressed them directly
2,6,6,and entreated permission to introduce his friend
3,6,6,Mr Wickham
4,6,6,who had returned with him the day before from town
5,0,happy,and he was happy to say
6,6,0,had accepted a commission in their corps .
2481 14
 (10, 9),
1,6,6,By tea-time
2,6,6,however
3,6,6,the dose had been enough
4,6,6,and Mr Bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing-room again
5,6,6,and when tea was over
6,6,6,glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies
7,6,6,Mr Collins readily assented
8,6,6,and a book was produced
9,6,4,but on beholding it ( for every thing announced it to be from a circulating library )
10,4,started back,he started back
11,6,6,and begging pardon
12,6,6,protested that he never read novels
13,6,6,Kitty stared at him
14,6,6,and Lydia exclaimed .
2482 7
 (7, 7),
1,6,6,To Catherine and Lydia
2,6,6,neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting
3,6,6,It was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat
4,6,6,and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour
5,6,6,As for their mother
6,6,6,Mr Collins 's letter had done away much of her ill-will
7,3,3,and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters .
2483 5
 (4, 3),
1,6,6,"  It is not Mr Bingley

3,6,3,"  it is a person whom I never saw in the whole course of my life

 (8, 8),(8, 9),
1,6,6,They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother
2,6,6,Mrs
3,6,6,Bennet wondered at their coming
4,6,6,and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble
5,6,6,and was sure Jane would have caught cold again
6,6,6,But their father
7,6,6,though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure
8,0,0,was really glad to see them
9,6,0,he had felt their importance in the family circle
10,6,6,The evening conversation
11,6,6,when they were all assembled
12,6,6,had lost much of its animation
13,6,6,and almost all its sense
14,6,6,by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth .

1,6,6,"  ee ee ee

7,6,4,i 'll die rather
8,6,6,Why
9,4,anxiously,"   asked Eustace anxiously
10,6,6,"  What 's so dreadful about it
2491 6
 (4, 4),
1,6,6,Jo happened to suit Aunt March
2,6,6,who was lame and needed an active person to wait upon her
3,6,6,The childless old lady had offered to adopt one of the girls when the troubles came
4,1,1,and was much offended because her offer was declined
5,6,6,Other friends told the Marches that they had lost all chance of being remembered in the rich old lady 's will
6,6,6,but the unworldly Marches only said
2492 14
 (7, 8),
1,6,6,The old lady would n't speak to them for a time
2,6,6,but happening to meet Jo at a friend 's
3,6,6,something in her comical face and blunt manners struck the old lady 's fancy
4,6,6,and she proposed to take her for a companion
5,6,6,This did not suit Jo at all
6,6,6,but she accepted the place since nothing better appeared and
7,3,to every one 's 3,to every one 's 3
8,6,3,got on remarkably well with her irascible relative
9,6,6,There was an occasional tempest
10,6,6,and once Jo marched home
11,6,6,declaring she could n't bear it longer
12,6,6,but Aunt March always cleared up quickly
13,6,6,and sent for her to come back again with such urgency that she could not refuse
14,6,6,for in her heart she rather liked the peppery old lady .
2493 15
 (15, 14),(15, 15),
1,6,6,Jo 's ambition was to do something very splendid
2,6,6,What it was
3,6,6,she had no idea as yet
4,6,6,but left it for time to tell her
5,6,6,and meanwhile
6,6,6,found her greatest affliction in the fact that she could n't read
7,6,6,run
8,6,6,and ride as much as she liked
9,6,6,A quick temper
10,6,6,sharp tongue
11,6,6,and restless spirit were always getting her into scrapes
12,6,6,and her life was a series of ups and downs
13,6,6,which were both comic and pathetic
14,6,0,But the training she received at Aunt March 's was just what she needed
15,0,0,and the thought that she was doing something to support herself made her happy in spite of the perpetual  "  josy phine
2494 18
 (10, 9),
1,6,6,One forlorn fragment of dollanity had belonged to Jo and
2,6,6,having led a tempestuous life
3,6,6,was left a wreck in the rag bag
4,6,6,from which dreary poorhouse it was rescued by Beth and taken to her refuge
5,6,6,Having no top to its head
6,6,6,she tied on a neat little cap
7,6,6,and as both arms and legs were gone
8,6,6,she hid these deficiencies by folding it in a blanket and devoting her best bed to this chronic invalid
9,6,0,If anyone had known the care lavished on that dolly
10,0,touched their hearts,I think it would have touched their hearts
11,6,6,even while they laughed
12,6,6,She brought it bits of bouquets
13,6,6,she read to it
14,6,6,took it out to breathe fresh air
15,6,6,hidden under her coat
16,6,6,she sang it lullabies and never went to bed without kissing its dirty face and whispering tenderly
17,6,6,"  I hope youll have a good night
18,6,6,my poor dear .  "
2495 8
 (3, 4),
1,6,6,Beth had her troubles as well as the others
2,6,6,and not being an angel but a very human little girl
3,1,wept a little weep,she often wept a little weep as Jo said
4,6,1,because she could n't take music lessons and have a fine piano
5,6,6,She loved music so dearly
6,6,6,tried so hard to learn
7,6,6,and practiced away so patiently at the jingling old instrument
8,6,6,that it did seem as if someone ( not to hint Aunt March ) ought to help her .
2496 14
 (5, 5),(5, 6),
1,6,6,She got through her lessons as well as she could
2,6,6,and managed to escape reprimands by being a model of deportment
3,6,6,She was a great favorite with her mates
4,6,6,being good tempered and possessing the happy art of pleasing without effort
5,0,0,Her little airs and graces were much admired
6,6,0,so were her accomplishments
7,6,6,for besides her drawing
8,6,6,she could play twelve tunes
9,6,6,crochet
10,6,6,and read French without mispronouncing more than two-thirds of the words
11,6,6,She had a plaintive way of saying
12,6,6,"  When Papa was rich we did so-and-so
13,6,6,"   which was very touching
14,6,6,and her long words were considered perfectly elegant by the girls .
2497 16
 (3, 3),
1,6,6,"  Being sensible girls
2,6,6,they decided to try her advice
3,3,3,and soon were 3d to see how well off they were
4,6,6,One discovered that money could n't keep shame and sorrow out of rich people 's houses
5,6,6,another that
6,6,6,though she was poor
7,6,6,she was a great deal happier
8,6,6,with her youth
9,6,6,health
10,6,6,and good spirits
11,6,6,than a certain fretful
12,6,6,feeble old lady who could n't enjoy her comforts
13,6,6,a third that
14,6,6,disagreeable as it was to help get dinner
15,6,6,it was harder still to go begging for it and the fourth
16,6,6,that even carnelian rings were not so valuable as good behavior .

1,6,6,"  Beth
2,6,5,if you dont keep these horrid cats down cellar i 'll have them drowned
