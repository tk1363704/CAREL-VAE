7,0,6,that sounds good . I'm going to start with an Italian tiramisu .
8,0,6,do you want to try some of my yogurt . It's a favorite everyday dessert in Greece .

3,6,6,Well  yes  we are  madam . The shop shuts down in five minutes .
4,6,6,I shall not keep you long then . It was about some saucepans you had in your window last week .
5,6,6,Last week  madam ? I really can't remember which ones you mean . What were they like ?
6,0,6,Oh  they were lovely . Sort of imitation wood  dark brown color  country-style you know  and the lids  if I remember rightly  they had a sort of leaf pattern  or was it flowers ?
7,6,6,That's strange . I don't recognize any of the ones we had from that description . Are you sure they were in this shop ?
8,6,6,Oh  you must know the ones I mean . They were on sale  a real bargain . Reduced to a quarter of the original price . I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw them .
9,1,6,I am afraid the sales are over now  madam . And you know we all sold out of the saucepans .
10,6,6,I don't think you did  you know . My neighbor told me she saw some here only yesterday .
11,6,6,Well  it's all new stock in the window now .
12,6,6,May I just have a look  to see if there is anything else ?
13,6,6,Eh  well  madam  as you know we are closing .
14,6,6,Yes  yes  I am sorry I won't keep you . It must get on your nerves when customers come in right at closing time . But they were such beautiful saucepans . I ' d have bought them if I had made up my mind on the spot .
15,6,6,Perhaps madam  if you come back tomorrow  I could show you the whole range of kitchen ware . And there are still one or two things at the sale price .
16,0,6,Oh  look ! That was the one there . That is the sort of thing I was looking for . But it's not quite the color .
17,6,6,That might be the artificial lighting  madam . Of course  if you could come back in daylight  you might find it ' s exactly what you are looking for .
18,0,6,There it is . That is the pattern ! The set behind you . Thank goodness  they haven't been sold . And thank you so much for being so patient with me . Yes  those are the ones .

2,6,6,What ?
3,6,6,I went down to change some money  right ?
4,6,6,Yes . We need some . How much did you change ?
5,6,6,I wanted to change around 5000 dollars . And you know the exchange rate .
6,6,6,Yes  it's about 35 pesos for every Taiwan dollar  right ?
7,6,6,Not today .
8,3,6,What do you mean ?
9,6,6,I went into the bank with my money  and I looked at the exchange board . At first I couldn't believe it . I thought I was reading the board wrong or something .
10,3,6,Why ?
11,3,6,Because the board said 60 pesos for every Taiwan dollar .
12,6,6,Sixty ? That's too much . How can that be ?
13,6,6,I thought it was wrong too . It didn't make sense .
14,3,6,Just two days ago it was 35 . How can it be 60 ?
15,6,6,So  I went up to the teller and started to exchange the money . And it's true . They really gave me sixty pesos for the dollar .
16,3,6,That's amazing ! Really ? How could it change so much in two days ?

6,6,6,You know  my dad had scrambled eggs every morning for twenty years . It drove my mom crazy !
7,6,6,You know what really drives me crazy ? When I ask for soft boiled eggs  and they overcook them  so they come out hard boiled ! How can you dipyour toast into a hard boiled egg ?

7,6,6,How about this scarf  these earrings  AMD an anklet ?
8,6,6,That might be going overboard a bit . How about just that scarf with a bracelet ?

13,6,6,The leopard print sounds fabulous . Are they a name brand ?
14,6,6,No  they ' re a Prada knock-off for 1/10 of the price of the real thing .

4,6,6,You should get plenty of sleep .
5,1,6,I drink a lot of wine .
6,6,6,If I were you  I wouldn't drink too much .
7,1,6,I often feel so tired .

2,6,6,Sure  but I don't drink much . So I don't know what to order .
3,6,6,So how about an aperitif ?
4,6,6,It sounds good . I'd like to start with a Compare .
5,6,6,Stirred or shaken ?
6,6,6,Stirred will be fine .
7,6,6,Here you are .

10,6,6,Can you recommend one ?
11,6,6,Try a Stinger . It has lime juice and grenadine over ice .
12,0,6,It sounds interesting . I'll take one .

1,0,6,Matthew ? Hi !
2,0,6,Steve ! Haven't seen you in ages ! How long's it been ?
3,0,6,It's got to be almost a year now .
4,0,6,How have you been ?
5,0,6,I'm pretty good . I've been looking for a place to live recently . My lease runs out next month and I don't want to renew it .
6,6,6,Yeah  I remember the neighborhood . Have you found a place yet ?
7,6,6,Not yet . But I am still looking through the classifieds . Wish me luck .
8,0,6,Well  maybe I can help . Remember my neighbor ?
9,6,6,Mrs . Thou ?
10,0,6,Yes  her daughter's having a baby  so she's moving in with her to help out . I think if you are interested  you can come over and have a look .
11,0,6,Great . It's a lovely neighborhood . And it would be nice to be neighbors again . It would be just like the old days !
12,0,6,I'll ask Mrs . Thou when she's available to show the apartment and let you know . Has your number changed ?

1,6,6,Listen  Karen  I need your help . I don't know anyone here yet .
2,0,6,I'm glad to help you . What's wrong ?
3,6,6,My mother-in-law just went into the hospital in L . A . Hank and I will be flying there tonight .
4,1,6,I'm sorry to hear it . What's wrong with her ?
5,6,6,Doctors aren't sure yet . But the real problem is Suzy . She has a bad cold  and we don't want to take her with us . But we don't know who can stay with her .
6,6,6,You need a babysitter .
7,6,6,Yes  I'd ask Jill  the girl I've had before  but I need someone overnight . Maybe even for two nights .
8,6,6,I could have Suzy stay at my place .
9,6,6,I don't want to do that to you  Karen .
10,6,6,Why not ?
11,6,6,Your own kids would get Suzy's cold . I think it would be better to have a good babysitter here . But I don't know who to ask . I need someone more mature than Jill . It might even be for two or three days .
12,6,6,I know who we can ask . There is a girl I know  Sara Ralston . She is 17  and she will usually take this kind of job . I know her from my church  and I trust her completely .
13,6,6,I'd like to talk with her . This is short notice  I know . But Hank and I are leaving tonight .
14,6,6,I'll get you her number . I hope she can do it . She is very responsible .
15,0,6,I'm glad you know someone . I knew you would be the best person to ask about this . I don't want to insult Jill or her mother . I think Jill maybe could do it . But I'd rather have someone a little older .
16,6,6,I'll go home and get Sara's number . I'll call her first myself .
17,0,6,Great . Then call me and let me know if she's free .

1,6,6,Wow ! It's hot today ! Do you want to get an ice cream cone ?
2,6,6,No Let's go to an ice cream parlor ! They have way more flavors to choose from there . I feel like having something special like Neapolitan ice cream .
3,6,6,What's that ?
4,6,6,It's three different flavors mixed together . Chocolate  strawberry and something green with candied fruit .
5,6,6,Do they have ice cream bars . frozen yogurt or frozen chocolate mousse ?
6,0,6,Absolutely ! They also have real Italian Galatian and French sorbets . They do a great baked Alaska .
7,6,6,Maybe a vanilla ice cream milkshake would be good . What's your favorite flavor ?
8,0,6,Well ... l like the traditional flavors like rum raisin  butter pecan . maple walnut  strawberry  chocolate and vanilla . But now there are some new flavors from Asia like green tea and durian .
9,0,6,God ! Even talking about it makes me feel like l'm gaining weight !

2,6,6,Come on  don ' t be so dramatic ! I ' m sure everything is going to work out just fine .
3,5,6,You think so ? Oh  no ! How can he do this to me ? I ' m sure he ' s cheating on me ! Why else wouldn ' t he call ?
4,6,6,But  you two are on a break . Theoretically he can do whatever he likes .
5,1,6,He ' s the love of my life ! I ' Ve really messed this up .
6,6,6,Come on  hon . Pull yourself together . It ' s going to be alright .
7,1,6,But I ... I still love him ! And it ' s all my fault ! I can ' t believe how immature and selfish I was being . I mean  he is a firefighter  it ' s not like he can just leave someone in a burning building and meet me for dinner . I ' Ve totally messed this up !
8,6,6,You know what  Veronica  I think you should make the first step . I ' m sure he ' ll forgive you ...

5,6,6,are you available on Sunday ?
6,6,6,yes  that's my only day off until Thursday .
7,6,6,ok  well  my friends and I are planning on going to the beach on Sunday . We tend to leave around noon whenever we go anywhere  so you could still sleep in . Do you want to come with us ?
8,0,6,that'd be fantastic ! Which beach are you going to ?
9,6,6,it's a quiet beach just about an hour outside of the city .
10,6,6,what should I bring with me ?
11,6,6,we've got plenty of inflatables  but if you want to sit on a chair  you'll have to bring your own sunlounger .
12,6,6,I can just use my beach towel . I love lazing around in the sun .
13,6,6,do you like surfing ?
14,6,6,I've actually never tired . Do you have a surfboard ?

16,6,6,I can't wait ! It sounds like we're going to have a great time . How much money should I bring ?
17,6,6,you'll just need roughly $ 10 for food and gas money . My friend is driving  so we usually all chip in a few dollars for gas money .
18,6,6,ok  where and when should I meet you ?

2,1,6,Someone has stolen my gold necklace .
3,6,6,I am sorry to hear about that . Would you mind coming with me to my office and tell me exactly what happened here ?
4,6,6,Of course not .
5,6,6,Are you sure that it isn't somewhere in your room ?
6,6,6,Yes  I've looked everywhere in my room and I can ' t find it .
7,6,6,Ok  when and where did you last see it ?
8,6,6,Last night on the dresser . I took it off before I went to the shower  and forgot to put it back on after the shower . And this morning I left the hotel in a hurry without wearing it .
9,6,6,Are you sure you didn't wear it this morning ?
10,6,6,Yes  I am positive .
11,6,6,Did you remember to lock your door before you left then ?
12,5,6,Yes  I think I did . It has to be one of your maids who took it . I want my necklace back .
13,6,6,Well  I understand how you feel  and we will try to do our best to help you . But first please allow me to send one of the housemaids to your room to look for it again thoroughly  just in case it's still in there . If she finds it  we will all be happy . If she doesn't  we will turn the whole matter to the police . But I must say that the hotel can't be held responsible for your loss . You should have locked your gold necklace away at the hotel ' s safety box . If you had read your key card carefully  you would have realized that we specially warned you to do so .
14,5,6,That just isn't good enough . Cet me your general manager . I want to speak to him now .
15,6,6,I am sorry  ma ' am . Our general manager is not in town . But I ' d be more than glad to get you our assistant manager  if you like . But I am afraid that he will say the same thing . We have very clear instructions about valuables and we must follow them . And now if you will excuse me  I'll go and find our assistant manager for you .

4,6,6,I had fried shrimp and clams for lunch .
5,6,6,Perhaps the food was bad .
6,1,6,Perhaps  but I haven ' t felt well for a few days now .
7,6,6,Has anything been upsetting you lately ?
8,1,6,My stress level is pretty much what is usually is .

5,2,6,It was hardly all night . And I recall it was you doing all the laughing at your own jokes .
6,1,6,That's not fair . We had fun . Give me a second chance . Can we meet tomorrow night for drinks at the pub ?

1,5,6,I just discovered that I owe $ 10 for a movie that I never ordered .
2,6,6,Let me check  sir . You were charged for watching ' Titanic ' Monday night .
3,5,6,That is absolutely incorrect ! I was out on the town Monday night .
4,6,6,Okay  sir  bear with me a moment .
5,6,6,Thank you for taking my word over the computer's word .
6,6,6,One slight problem  sir . I need to charge you $ 2 to remove this error from your file .
7,6,6,You can
8,6,6,I feel your pain  sir .

 (1, 1),(3, 3),(5, 5),
1,5,6,I swear I will never shop at a street market in China . It's a terrible place full of excellent profiteers ! You have to keep an eye whenever it comes to paying for something .
2,6,6,cool down  Harry ! What are you really mad about ? Did you get ripped off ?
3,5,6,yes . Last Sunday I went to a nearby market . It was on open-air fair . I chanced upon this bag and bought it on the spot  without even trying to strike a bargain . I paid one hundred and twenty . And just now I was told by my Chinese colleagues I bought it overpriced . I could have talked my way to thirty .
4,6,6,is that so ? I'm afraid people here will not take pity on unlucky guys like you . Bargaining has always been an indispensable procedure in business deals . It's the norm of free trade . The seller sets a preposterous price  and the buyer tries his best to bring it down  until a compromise is reached . Yet you ignored the process . No wonder you ended up easy prey .
5,5,6,but don't you think it annoying to overcharge the customers by such a handsome margin ?
6,6,6,of course  that's something really irritating . And the only way to avoid being trapped is to know in advance about the real worth of the stuff . I recommend you to consult the price tags in the supermarket first . And then you may negotiate for a fair deal .

5,6,6,But it's true .
6,5,6,How can believe it if the same excuse was used twice within a week ?
7,6,6,That's coincident .

2,6,6,Oh  I'm fine .
3,6,6,So  are you going to go to class tonight ?
4,1,6,Maybe ... but I don't think so .
5,3,6,Really ? What's the matter ?
6,1,6,I don't know . I'm just feeling a little sad .
7,0,6,Listen . Come with me to class  and after class we can go out for dinner .
8,0,6,Now that's a good idea . Thanks a lot  Brian . I'm feeling better already .

1,6,6,I like this apartment . Do you think we can afford the mortgage ?
2,0,6,Yes . I think so . It ' s not a very expensive apartment . It ' s in the right area and it has everything that we are looking for . The rooms are quite large too .
3,0,6,I love the balcony . We can sit outside and enjoy the sun in summer . We are on the 12th floor  so there ' s very nice view from the balcony .
4,0,6,The neighbourhood is nice too . There is a park nearby .
5,0,6,Yes  and there are many houses nearby . I like it that the neighbourhood isn ' t full of apartment blocks .
6,1,6,It ' s a pity we can ' t afford a house . A garden would be so nice .
7,6,6,Yes  it would . Don ' t worry . There ' s a lawn outside the building and there ' s the park nearby . This place will be fine .
8,0,6,The building is quite new and well constructed . I ' m happy with the fittings too .
9,0,6,Yes  everything has been well designed .

1,0,6,What a beautiful watch . It goes very well with your ring .
2,0,6,Thank you .
3,0,6,Is that your wedding ring ?
4,0,6,I'm not married yet . It's my engagement ring .
5,0,6,Well  congratulations . When is the big date ?
6,0,6,In June .
7,0,6,Did you have the watch before getting the ring ?
8,0,6,Actually  we bought the ring together after I got the watch .
9,0,6,You did a fabulous job with the selection . It's gorgeous .
10,0,6,Thank you so much .
11,6,6,What kind of watch is it ?
12,6,6,It's a Tag Heer .
13,6,6,If you don't mind me asking  how much do they cost ?
14,6,6,This one is $ 1500 . But they range from $ 600 to $ 3000 .
15,0,6,That's why it looks so nice . I should have figured . You always get what you pay for .
16,0,6,Yeah . I would rather get one nice watch instead of 20 mediocre ones .

1,6,6,Well  Yuri  tell me about it .
2,6,6,I'm sorry I can't bring better news  sir . The site is a disaster .
3,6,6,That's what I was afraid of .
4,6,6,It is not only the earthquake  sir . But the mudslides . Much of the north half of the site has been covered over by mud .
5,3,6,Mud ? But Ivan told me there were no mudslides in that district . I thought all the mudslides were down in Chichitango .
6,6,6,That's what we thought  sir . That's what the news reported . But there was one little mudslide in our district too . Right above our site .
7,1,6,Oh  that's terrible ! What bad luck ! I wish we had never come to this country . But  if it isn't the strikes and the revolutionaries  it's the earthquakes . Our operations here are finished !
8,1,6,I'm sorry  sir .
9,6,6,It's not your fault  Yuri . But tell me . When will Ivan be able to get out there ?
10,6,6,Well  it took me about nine hours to get back here by car . If Ivan leaves tonight  I think he should be there by tomorrow lunch .
11,6,6,Good . I want an estimate of damages as soon as possible .
12,6,6,But sir ...
13,6,6,Yes  Yuri ?
14,6,6,I wouldn't recommend sending Ivan now . Especially not at night . The roads aren't safe .
15,6,6,Has the earthquake damaged the bridges too ?
16,6,6,No  sir . The bridges are fine . But I've heard rumors that the revolutionaries are coming down from the mountains . There has been fighting  sir .
17,6,6,Are you serious ? Fighting ? But I didn't hear anything on the news .
18,6,6,You know the government controls the press here  sir . They don't want it reported .
19,1,6,Oh  this is terrible  Yuri . Terrible ! So we can't even assess the damages . How can we do business in this country ? Either we're buried under mud  or we're in danger of getting kidnapped . No  I can't believe this mess !
20,1,6,I'm sorry  sir .
21,1,6,You don't have to keep saying that  Yuri . It's not your fault . But me--I'm the one who should be sorry . It was me who suggested operations here in the first place ! Oh  what can we do ?

1,6,6,Alright  tell me what you think about this one .
2,6,6,Don't you think it's a bit bright ?
3,6,6,Yeah  maybe you're right . How about this outfit ?
4,6,6,That dress looks lovely on you  but it's not very practical  is it ?
5,0,6,No  I don't have any plans to go to a formal dance any time soon  but I love the way it looks . I just want to try it on ! What do you think about this ? It's casual  yet sophisticated .
6,6,6,I like the jeans  but you need something to go with the top . It's too plain on its own .
7,6,6,How about this scarf  these earrings  and an anklet ?
8,6,6,That might be going overboard a bit . How about just that scarf with a bracelet ?
9,0,6,That's a good idea . You have a lot of good fashion sense .
10,0,6,Thanks . You'd be OK on your own . There are loads of fashion victims out there  and you are not one of them . Have you tried it on yet ?
11,6,6,Yep . Here it is . What do you think ?
12,0,6,That looks great . Just one more thing-you need some high heels with those jeans . Do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ?
13,0,6,The leopard print sounds fabulous . OK  I'll take it .

2,0,6,I'd love to ! But I have never learned martial arts  and there is only a month left before the New Year .
3,6,6,That's OK . A month is enough for you to learn the basic movements . It would be great to have you with us on the show .
4,0,6,Sounds great ! Shall I learn the actions that Jet Li did in the movies ?
5,6,6,No . You know  there are many schools and styles of kung fu . What we will perform is a set of Chinese shadow boxing .
6,0,6,Whatever ! I'm glad to learn something of Chinese kung fu . Thanks for asking me .

3,4,6,I think someone is stalking me .
4,3,6,No  it can't be . Really ? Who ?
5,4,6,I don't know . I saw him the first time Tuesday . He was at the cafe . I noticed he was looking at me a lot . Not just the usual looking  but staring . He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop .
6,6,6,What did you do ?
7,4,6,I didn't do anything . Finally  he left . But then I saw him again today . Outside the shoe store . Near the cafe . I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's . But then he came in too .
8,6,6,Did he leave when you left ?
9,4,6,Yes . Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . He was following me .

5,0,6,I had a great time too and was thinking that maybe you might want to join me for a hike to the waterfalls on Saturday .
6,0,6,A hike would be great ! Let me pack us a nice picnic lunch  OK ?
7,0,6,Linda  that would be a perfect addition .
8,0,6,I'll take care of the lunch then  and you can take care of the other plans . What time would you like to pick me up ?
9,6,6,I was hoping to leave by 9 o'clock so that it won \ ' t be too hot for the hike .

4,0,6,Dessert sounds perfect  but I would like to split something with my friends .
5,6,6,On this evening's dessert list  we have chocolate mousse cake  homemade fresh strawberry shortcake  and a spicy rum apple crisp .
6,0,6,I think that the apple crisp would be wonderful .
7,6,6,One dessert will serve two  so would you like to split a second one ?
8,6,6,We would also like a piece of chocolate mousse cake . Could you bring us four dessert forks  please ?
9,6,6,How about some coffee and tea as well ?
10,6,6,We are all tea drinkers . Please bring us four teas .

5,6,6,Did you stop at the big waterfall for pictures ?
6,0,6,Sure  we wouldn't miss it for anything . After that  we took a short cut to the park . There was very little traffic  so we got there in less than an hour .
7,0,6,You were lucky then . What did you do after that ?
8,0,6,We went for a swim in the sea . That was the best part of the day . Just look at my nice tan .
9,0,6,So you must have had a busy and enjoyable day yesterday .

3,5,6,You can't be serious !
4,5,6,Hey  I've always gone hunting or fishing on vacation . I am sorry that bothers you .
5,5,6,After a year together  I thought it pretty safe to assume that we would automatically spend our vacation together .
6,5,6,Says who ? I don't think that is necessarily the case .

2,6,6,Dan is on top of that . I think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
3,5,6,That would be convenient . They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . The circuit breakers keep going out all the time . It ' s really annoying !
4,5,6,Yeah you are right . This office is falling apart ! Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that ' s why the parking lot was flooded .
5,5,6,I know ! I was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! The handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .

4,0,6,You should . Many Guiliners  especially the old and the young  will climb mountains here in the morning .
5,0,6,No wonder people say
6,3,6,Quick ! Pass me your binoculars . Look at that bird ... I've never seen one of those before . It's indigenous to Guiling  and an endangered species too . This is lucky !
7,0,6,I didn't know you liked bird-watching .

2,0,6,Thank you  Rick ! As you can see  ladies and gentleman  we are here in beautiful Pebble Beach where the top golfers in the world are trying to win the grand prize of one million dollars !
3,0,6,Whoa  that ' s a lot of cash ! Let ' s go to the course and see how Tiger Woods is doing .
4,0,6,All right  we are here at the eighth hole . It ' s a par four  and has some very difficult hazards which many golfers find difficult to avoid . Although  I did see Jack Nicklaus hit a hole in one on this very same hole !
5,0,6,Tiger Woods is about to tee off  and let ' s see if he has the same luck as Jack . Tiger is asking his caddie for his driver and  he seems to be very nervous .
6,1,6,Oh no ! Not a good swing at all ! It ' s definitely not his day today . On the seventh hole he got a bogey and before that he barely made par . He will definitely not get a birdie on this shot .
7,1,6,It seems that his ball has flown somewhere deep in the trees . He is having a hard time finding it and even his caddie has climbed a tree to try and spot it .
8,4,6,Oh no ! A bear ! Run  Tiger  run ! Somebody call animal control !

8,6,6,You can have a free facial and then make up free for you . Do you want it now ?
9,1,6,Probably not . Doing that will probably take another three hours which I can't afford now .
10,6,6,Here is our number . Call us when you are ready to come .

1,6,6,Hi  Mary  I have decided to look for a job as a salesman .
2,6,6,Good ! Have you got the recruitment information on marketing ?
3,6,6,Yes . I have found some through different channels .
4,3,6,Really ? That's great ! Tell me .
5,6,6,OK . The first piece of job information I got was from the Internet  and it is about selling medicines .
6,6,6,What do you think of this job ?
7,6,6,I am not familiar with the medicine industry  and I don't think it fits me well .
8,6,6,Then how about the others ?
9,6,6,Another is about electronic commerce  and its products are mainly large machinery equipments .
10,6,6,I have heard about electronic commerce  and many people say it has good prospects for development .
11,6,6,I also feel it's nice . I want to give it a try .
12,0,6,Come on ! I believe you will succeed .
13,0,6,Thanks . You can also seek job information on the Internet .
14,0,6,Good idea . I will think it over .

1,5,6,I can't stand the stupid guy any longer . It's unbelievable .
2,6,6,Oh  my dear lady  take it easy . You should forgive a green hand like him .
3,5,6,He does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy .
4,6,6,I suggest you talk with him and teach him how to deal with the problems .
5,5,6,I've told him how to do that several times  but he's never listened to me .
6,6,6,Maybe you should communicate with him just like a friend  not a boss .
7,1,6,Oh  I always have difficulty in getting along with the staff .
8,6,6,Just take them for your good friends and have a talk with them as we do . Make sure you won't lose your temper !
9,6,6,Oh  so bad . I'm afraid I'll change the image of myself .
10,6,6,No  it's unnecessary . Just respect the staff and their own opinions .
11,6,6,But sometimes they offer some useless proposals  it's awfully useless .
12,6,6,Oh  no one is perfect .
13,6,6,That's right . I should speak to them in a polite way .
14,6,6,We have the equal partnership in team .
15,0,6,Thanks very much and you're very eloquent .
16,0,6,Thanks for saying that .

1,4,6,That was really a nightmare !
2,6,6,Honey  what's up ?
3,4,6,I was stuck between 15th and 16th floors in the elevator .
4,3,6,Oh  really ? I know that telephone signal must have been shielded in the elevator shaft  so what did you do then ?
5,4,6,I pressed the emergency button ! And then I stayed in the elevator waiting for the rescue .
6,6,6,Did you panic at the time ?
7,6,6,A little bit  but I know that the elevator isn't enclosed . at least I wouldn't be smothered there .
8,6,6,Was there anyone else with you ?
9,6,6,Of course  there are 6 other people in the elevator ; they were so scared that someone even started crying .
10,6,6,So you mean that you were the only brave one there ?
11,6,6,Yes . I have to call the property management .
12,6,6,For what ? Complaining about what happened in the elevator ?
13,6,6,Yes . They should check the elevator regularly . I have to give them something to remember about  and they should also equip fire extinguishers in the building .
14,6,6,That was just an accident . you are worried too much about it . I think the property management will check the elevator and improve their service from now on .
15,6,6,I know what you mean  but I'd better remind them again  and also remind them to repair the button in the elevator for the disabled people . That has brought the disabled people lots of inconvenience .

1,0,6,Great . The bed is exactly what I have been looking for !
2,6,6,You have good taste . It's made of red wood .
3,6,6,Oh  I like red wood . How much do you charge for it ?
4,6,6,300 dollars .
5,5,6,That's sheer robbery !
6,6,6,Believe me  it's worth the price .
7,6,6,It's more than I can afford . Can I make an offer ?
8,6,6,How much are you willing to pay ?
9,6,6,Shall we make it 250 dollars ?
10,1,6,No . That price would hardly cover the cost .
11,6,6,What about 260 dollars ?
12,6,6,275 dollars is the lowest price I can offer .
13,0,6,It's a deal .

1,6,6,You ' re home late today  David . How was school ?
2,6,6,Not bad . There ' s a new English teacher .
3,6,6,Oh  what ' s she like ?
4,0,6,She is beautiful .
5,6,6,Is she old or young ?
6,0,6,She is quite young and her hair is blond .
7,6,6,Is she strict ?
8,0,6,Not really . Her eyes are blue .
9,6,6,Can she speak Chinese ?
10,0,6,Not much . She is very tall and slim .
11,6,6,David  stop dreaming . It ' s time to do your homework .

1,6,6,Have you got your invitation yet ?
2,3,6,My invitation ? No  I haven't . My invitation to what ?
3,6,6,The house warming party .
4,6,6,Whose house warming party is it ?
5,6,6,Tom and Bill Smith . They are both working now you know ? And they've bought a new house .
6,3,6,Oh  they have ? I didn't know . I haven't seen Tom lately .
7,6,6,It's out in the suburbs .
8,6,6,Have you seen the house ?
9,6,6,Yes  I have . I went out with them last weekend .
10,6,6,Is it nice ?
11,6,6,Yes  it is . There are three bedrooms  a living room  a dining room  and a big kitchen . There's also a garden .
12,0,6,Well  that does sound nice . Have they moved in yet ?
13,6,6,They are moving today . Tom's taken the day off . He's rented a truck  and they should have all their furniture in the house tonight .
14,6,6,When are they going to have the party ?
15,6,6,Next Saturday night . You should get your invitation today or tomorrow .
16,0,6,Wow  that would be something to look forward to .

 (9, 6),(9, 7),(9, 8),(10, 9),(12, 11),(12, 12),(17, 16),(17, 17),
1,6,6,alright  tell me what you think .
2,6,6,don't you think it ' s a bit bright ?
3,6,6,yeah  maybe you ' re right . How about this outfit ?
4,6,6,that dress looks lovely on you  but it ' s not very practical  is it ?
5,6,6,no  I don't have an plans to go to a formal dance any time soon  but I love the way it looks . I just had to try it on ! What do you think about this ? It ' s casual  yet sophisticated .
6,6,6,I like the jeans  but you need something to go with the top . It ' s too plain on its own .
7,6,6,how about this scarf  these earrings  and an anklet ?
8,6,6,that might be going overboard a bit . How about just that scarf with a bracelet ?
9,0,6,that ' s a good idea . You have a lot of good fashion sense .
10,0,6,thanks . You ' d be ok on your own . There are loads of fashion victims out there  and you are not one of them . Have you tried it on yet ?
11,6,6,yep . Here it is . What do you think ?
12,0,6,that looks great . Just one more thing---you need some high heels with those jeans . Do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ?
13,6,6,the leopard print sounds fabulous . Are they a name brand ?
14,6,6,no  they ' re a Prada knock-off for 1/10 of the price of the real thing .
15,6,6,that ' s even better than the real thing .
16,6,6,if I were you  I ' d buy that now while it ' s on sale . If you spend more than $ 100  you get a $ 50 voucher for more clothes .
17,1,6,it ' s too bad I did all that shopping yesterday !

 (1, 1),(2, 1),(3, 3),(4, 3),(4, 4),(5, 4),(6, 5),(13, 12),
1,0,6,Hey  Blake ! Are you still listening to Mozart ?
2,0,6,Yes . Do you like it ?
3,0,6,It's great . and I ' Ve heard that listening to Mozart can make you more intelligent .
4,3,6,Really ? I've never heard that before . I just like it .
5,0,6,Is classical music your favorite ?
6,0,6,Yes . What about you ?
7,6,6,I Like pop music best . Classical music is a bit too heavy for me . I can't get fully relaxed in it .
8,6,6,Pop music doesn't have any depth for me .
9,6,6,Yeah  that's why I can enjoy myself in it .
10,6,6,Did you always like pop music .
11,6,6,I think so  since I was in primary school . How long have you been interested in classical music .
12,6,6,I didn't like it at all until I started to learn violin when I was eight . From then on . classical music has been an important part of my life .
13,3,6,oh  I didn't know you can play the violin . Do you still play .
14,6,6,Sometimes  but these days I'm often too busy .

1,6,6,Hello  ma ' am  can I help you find something ?
2,6,6,Yes  actually I ' m looking to buy a camera .
3,6,6,We ' Ve got a wide selection do you know if you ' d like a point-and-shoot  or something a little fancier ? Are you shopping for yourself or for someone else ?
4,6,6,Actually I ' m buying a camera for my husband .
5,6,6,Ah  well then I ' d recommend a nice entry-level digital SLR .
6,6,6,Yeah ? Can I take a look at the Sirs you carry ?
7,0,6,Sure thing  follow me . This here is the .
8,6,6,The Canon Eos . Yeah it ' s ok  but I ' m looking for something that performs better in low light  has a better display panel  and longer battery life .
9,6,6,Oh  ah  um the Nikon D60 is a nice option .
10,6,6,Yeah  but what kit lens does this camera come with ? I don ' t want some bulky telephoto lens .
11,6,6,Oh  well this one has the  uh .
12,6,6,Looks to me like an 18-55 mm lens . pretty standard  that will do . Not like my husband will be stalking celebrities or anything !
13,6,6,So  ahem  can I interest you in any acc ...
14,6,6,Accessories ? Do you carry polarizing filters ?
15,1,6,Polarizing filter um we should ! I ' m sorry  ma ' am . It looks like we ' re sold out .
16,0,6,No you ' re not ! There are some right here !
17,0,6,Oh  well  would you look at that ! Polarizing filters .
18,0,6,Thanks for your help  Ralph !

1,0,6,Hi ! I see you are having fun with your new computer and internet connection .
2,6,6,There ' s so much I want to do . I ' Ve just finished sending lots of emails to friends and family all over the world . I just ran a search for music to download .
3,6,6,I can give you the name of a few useful website to visit .
4,0,6,Thanks . That would be very helpful . I ' Ve discovered that it can take a long time to find exactly what you want . There ' s too much information on the net .
5,6,6,When you sent your emails  did you attach any files to them ?
6,6,6,Yes  I did . There ' s an anti-virus programme with my email account that scans all attachments  so I ' m sure I haven ' t sent anything nasty to anyone .
7,6,6,When you use the internet  be careful not to give out your email address very often . If you do  you might get a lot of spam-unwanted email form companies trying to sell you things .
8,0,6,That ' s good advice . I should also be careful about giving out confidential information about myself  such as my password and credit car number .
9,6,6,That ' s right . Another thing to remember when you are surfing is that you can add a web page to your list of favourites . Your computer will remember the page and you can return there quickly next time
10,6,6,How do I do that ?
11,6,6,Take this web page for example . Press the keys control and d together . Click on favourites at the top of the screen . There you are . It has been added to you favourites list . If you click it  you will
12,0,6,That ' s useful to know . Thanks . I ' ll just log off and shout down my computer and we can go for a coffee .

 (4, 3),(4, 4),(13, 13),(15, 14),(23, 22),
1,5,6,Ah ! No ! Damn it !
2,6,6,It's a blackout . Now I can't see Seinfeld .
3,6,6,So what ? I just lost one hour's worth of work .
4,3,6,Really ? How could you do that ? Don't you save every couple minutes ?
5,6,6,No  I didn't save this time . Damn it ! And I'm sick of writing this paper . Now I have to write it all over again too .
6,6,6,I've had that problem too many times . So I learned to save . When I'm writing something  I save every three sentences or so . I don't want to lose anything .
7,6,6,I hate computers . Sometimes I think they cause more trouble than they're worth .
8,6,6,What are we going to do now ?
9,6,6,I don't know . I feel like going out .
10,6,6,I wonder how much of the city is down .
11,6,6,It doesn't matter . I still can go out and buy a beer .
12,6,6,Maybe . But if there's a blackout  probably the pubs are closed . And besides  I know you have a political science exam tomorrow . I thought you had a lot of reading to do .
13,5,6,Yes  that's true . Damn ! I just lost half my paper  and now I can't even do my homework . This is a bad time for this to happen .
14,6,6,I have a flashlight in my closet . If you want to use that to read  you can .
15,0,6,Thanks . I think I will try . Where are you going ?
16,6,6,I like your idea of getting a beer . I think I'll go out myself .
17,6,6,Maybe we can trade . Why don't you stay here and read for my exam  and I'll go drink beer ?
18,6,6,No  it just won't work . If I read for your exam  you won't know the answers tomorrow . I will .
19,6,6,So ? You can go to the class for me . Just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . Why not ?
20,6,6,How many students are in the class ?
21,6,6,About fourteen .
22,6,6,So it won't work  old buddy . They'll see that I'm not you . Sorry .
23,5,6,Damn !

1,6,6,Next please ! Hello sir  may I see your passport please ?
2,6,6,Yes  here you go .
3,6,6,Will you be checking any bags today .
4,6,6,Yes  I ' d like to check three pieces .
5,6,6,I ' m sorry  sir . Airline policy allows only two pieces of checked luggage  at twenty kilograms each  plus one piece of carry-on luggage . I will have to charge you extra for the additional suitcase .
6,5,6,What ? Why ! I am taking an intercontinental flight ! I ' m flying sixteen thousand CMS ! How am I supposed to only take two  twenty kilo bags ? That ' absurd !
7,6,6,I am sorry  sir  there ' s nothing I can do . You cannot board the flight with that large bag either . Carry - on bags must fit in the over-head compartment or under your seat . That bag is clearly too big .
8,5,6,Now I see . You charge next to nothing for an international ticket  but when it comes to charging for any other small thing  you charge an arm and a leg ! So tell me  miss  how much will I have to pay for all of this .
9,6,6,Let ' s see ... six hundred and twenty-five US dollars .
10,5,6,That ' s more than my round-trip ticket !

1,0,6,Morning  Peter . Nice suit ! A new one ?
2,0,6,Oh  yes . My wife bought it for me yesterday . Hmm  you look nice in that yellow dress . Yellow suits you really well .
3,6,6,Maybe . Several people have suggested that I get more yellow clothes . They say the color suits me because I have a fair complexion .
4,0,6,That's right . You know  pink  green and black could also be good for you . Actually  I think that all colors are okay for a person with your complexion . It's just that different colors can give people different impressions . For example  black could make you look mature  while pink could make you look young and energetic .
5,0,6,Thank you for your compliments . It sounds like you're a clothing expert .
6,0,6,Well  compared with my wife  I'm just a beginner .

2,2,6,I don't know . I just know I've never been asked so many questions in my life .
3,6,6,How many of them were there ?
4,2,6,Three-but there was one of them who kept asking really stupid questions .
5,6,6,Like what ?
6,2,6,Oh  he wanted to know what time I got up this morning and if I bad a bath or a shower you know  things like that .
7,6,6,What on earth has that got to do with some money disappearing ?
8,2,6,I've no idea . Oh yes  and the most ridiculous thing . He asked me what I had for breakfast this morning .
9,6,6,Oh well  that's it . They obviously think you're a desperate criminal and you have to steal to eat . I should think you'll get thirty years .
10,6,6,Hmm . Thank you very much .

1,0,6,Did you watch the final last night ? My favorite singer won !
2,0,6,Oh  I love him too . He not only sings well but also shows perseverance when he encounters difficulties in the contest .
3,0,6,Yeah  he got booted after his initial performance in the audition  but he did not give up . He then tried at another two auditions .
4,0,6,He had barely survived the third audition and finally got a chance to advance in the contest . Fortunately  in the third audition  he has won popularity among the audience . And that's when I started to notice him .
5,0,6,Me too .
6,0,6,Before he made the top three  I was so nervous . I just fear that he might be knocked out .
7,0,6,Yeah  there're so many excellent candidates out there . Who knows which one will make it to the final ?
8,0,6,Absolutely . That's why when he entered the final  I was so excited .
9,0,6,He really did a great job in the finale  especially in the PK round . He performed so well that the majority of the audience cast their votes for him .
10,0,6,And the host announced that he won it all !

2,6,6,Here you are .
3,6,6,Excuse me  sir . This is your passport .
4,3,6,Really ? Ugh ... Is there any difference ?
5,6,6,Yes . As a matter of fact  you can't board the plane without boarding pass .
6,1,6,Gee . I must have left it in my hotel room .
7,6,6,I'm sorry sir . I can't let you pass .
8,6,6,But when does the plane take off ?
9,6,6,Ugh  in about thirty minutes  sir .
10,1,6,Oh  my God ! What do I do now ? Bone head  bone head  bone head ( He smashes his head with his hand . ) .
11,6,6,Calm down  sir . You are creating a commotion .
12,6,6,( The speaker in the airport says  ' Mr . Benjamin  we now have a boarding pass by the name of Benjamin at Lost and Found . ' ) Is that me ?
13,6,6,Could be .
14,0,6,Oh  thank God . Thank you  I'll be right back .
15,6,6,( Benjamin starts to run and then he seems to remember something and returns . ) Ugh  excuse me  where is the Lost and Found ?
16,6,6,It's down in the lobby . Turn left at exit B .

1,6,6,Good morning . I ' m from the New York book review . Could I ask you some questions about your latest book ?
2,6,6,Sure . Take a seat ... what would you like to know ?
3,6,6,First  I ' Ve heard that your latest book is based on a true story .
4,0,6,That ' s correct . It ' s a murder mystery based on actual murders that book place in Florida several years ago . The main character-the police invesigator-is based on the man who investigated the case .
5,0,6,How do you research your books ?
6,0,6,I always visit the places that I use as setting for stories . Readers like things to be as factually correct as possible-even in fiction ! I usually base my characters on people I have met . Most character are a mixture of the characters of two or more people .
7,0,6,I really like your books . I ' Ve just finished this one . I read it from cover to cover in a single day . Congratulation on making the bestseller list yet again !
8,0,6,Thank you . Let met sign it for you ... there you go .
9,0,6,Oh ! Thank you very much . I heard that you are currently writing a collection of short stories . What are the stories about ?
10,0,6,There ' s a real mix of stories in the book . I haven ' t finished all of them yet  though . Many of them are short detective stories  but there are also horror stories and sci-fi ones . If you give me your business card  I ' ll make sure you get an advance copy to review .
11,0,6,Thanks very much . I ' m sure it will sell well . I can ' t wait to read it . Here ' s my card . Thank you for you time .

2,5,6,No  the steak was recommended  but it is not very fresh .
3,1,6,Oh ! Sorry to hear that . This is quite unusual as we have steak from the market every day .
4,5,6,So what ? It is not fresh and I'm not happy about it .
5,1,6,I'm sorry  sir . Do you wish to try something else ? That would be on the house  of course .
6,5,6,No  thank you .

3,6,6,It ' s certainly a pretty dress . I can ring you up at the register over here .
4,0,6,Great .
5,6,6,Will you be paying by cash  check  or credit card ?
6,6,6,I want to use a credit card . Do you take Discover ?
7,1,6,Sorry  no . We only take MasterCard or Visa .
8,6,6,I ' ll put it on my Visa card  then .
9,6,6,Very well  ma ' am . Oh  there seems to be a problem  it says it ' s rejected .
10,6,6,There must be something wrong with the system . Try my MasterCard .
11,0,6,Alright . Thank you . Yes  it seems to be working fine . Your total is $ 199 . 00  sign here  please .

3,6,6,They did ?
4,5,6,They had no reason for arresting me .
5,6,6,I thought they let you go .
6,6,6,Yes  the next morning .
7,6,6,They made you spend the night at the station ?
8,6,6,Yes  they did .
9,6,6,What was their reason for arresting you ?
10,6,6,I matched the description of a bank robber they were looking for .

9,6,6,I will  but let's go to the disco after dinner .

5,0,6,Would you like another beer ?
6,6,6,I'll have another cup of beer insist . I know I don't like to drink alone  especially there are someone sitting there next to me .

2,0,6,Thank you for meeting me here .
3,6,6,It's no problem .
4,6,6,I need to speak with you about your daughter .
5,6,6,Is there something wrong ?
6,0,6,I enjoy having your daughter in my class .
7,0,6,I'm glad to hear it .
8,0,6,She is a great addition to my class .
9,6,6,You don't have anything bad to say about her ?
10,0,6,She is always behaving herself  and she's so smart .
11,0,6,I am so happy that she's doing okay .
12,0,6,I'm more than happy having her in my class .

1,0,6,Everything is now . I'm kind of sick of it .
2,6,6,Each ring has 3 small diamonds inside the band .
3,0,6,Oooh ! One for each of the zeros in 2000 ! Wow !
4,6,6,Stop making fun of me .
5,0,6,So find a guy to marry and you can get one !
6,6,6,I don't need a guy to buy a wedding ring !
7,0,6,Oh  I see . You're going to wear one and pretend you're married to try to attract guys .

1,6,6,When will I get a raise ?
2,6,6,In three months or so ?
3,5,6,You said the same thing three months ago .
4,6,6,Did I ? Well . Anyway  you'll get your raise when the economy starts picking up .
5,5,6,You mean I won't get a raise until recession ends ?
6,6,6,Yes .
7,5,6,I got the message . I am quitting .

 (6, 6),(7, 6),(8, 8),(9, 8),(9, 9),
1,6,6,Hello  BCD Company  can I help you ?
2,6,6,Hello  may I speak to Mrs Smith ?
3,6,6,This is Mrs Smith  may I have your name ?
4,6,6,This is Sun  and I interviewed with you yesterday .
5,6,6,Hello  Mr . Sun .
6,0,6,I am calling to thank you for giving me the interview for the Sales Manager position yesterday .
7,0,6,You are welcome  Mr . Sun .
8,0,6,I really enjoyed meeting with you .
9,0,6,You certainly made a good impression on me  as well .
10,6,6,I am very interested in this position .
11,6,6,We'll be making the decision by the end of this week and we'll contact you as soon as possible .
12,6,6,Well  thank you for your time and consideration again .
13,6,6,You are welcome .

 (2, 2),(3, 2),(3, 3),(8, 7),
1,6,6,So can you fix it ?
2,1,6,I ' m sorry sir . This computer is not broken or damaged . It ' s simply just too old ! That ' s why your programs and applications are running slow . There really isn ' t much I can do .
3,3,6,What do you mean ? I bought this computer just three years ago !
4,6,6,Yes  but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster !
5,6,6,OK  I know where this is going . How much will it cost me to get a new computer ?
6,6,6,Well  this desktop over here is our latest model . It has a four gigahertz processor with sixteen gigabytes in RAM and a hard disk with one terabyte . Of course  it includes a mouse  keyboard and desk speakers .
7,6,6,I have no idea what you are talking about . I just want to know if it ' s good and if I will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time !
8,5,6,This PC is top of the line and I guarantee it will never freeze ! If it does  we ' ll give you your money back !
8728 14
 (1, 1),(2, 2),(5, 4),(14, 13),
1,0,6,it ' s so great to be here ! I ' m so excited to help you and my daughter with your new home !
2,0,6,we ' re glad that you ' re here . Would you like a tour of the house ?
3,6,6,that ' d be great  but could I have a cup of tea first ?
4,6,6,sure  I ' ll just go put the kettle on . Why don ' t you have a seat on the sofa and I ' ll go take care of things in the kitchen .
5,0,6,that would be lovely  thanks .
6,6,6,do you take milk or sugar with your tea ?
7,6,6,I ' ll take a little milk  but no sugar  please . Make sure you let the tea steep a few minutes before you take the tea bag out of the cup .
8,6,6,ok . What do you think about our living room ?
9,6,6,well  I do like the mantelpiece and the coffee table  but I don ' t really care for curtains . Did you get them at a yard sale ? They look ancient .
10,6,6,my parents gave them to us as a house warming gift .
11,6,6,oh dear . Well  I suppose they will do for now . do you ever dust in here ? It seems a bit dusty in here .
12,6,6,your daughter usually does the dusting  and I do the vacuuming .
13,6,6,I see . Well  I can help with the chores while I ' m here . You two could probably use my help .
14,0,6,that ' s very nice of you to offer . Here ' s your tea . Be careful  it ' s still quite hot .

 (1, 1),(2, 1),(3, 1),(3, 3),(4, 3),(4, 4),
1,0,6,Your knowledge of English is really surprising .
2,0,6,Oh  it's nothing to speak of .
3,0,6,No  seriously . I am impressed .
4,0,6,Thank you . I appreciate the compliment .

1,6,6,Are you going to vote this Tuesday ?
2,0,6,Yes  I am  and I am so excited .
3,6,6,Have you figured out who you ' re going to vote for ?
4,0,6,I love my candidate .
5,6,6,Why is that ?
6,0,6,My candidate is probably the most intelligent .
7,6,6,Is that right ?
8,0,6,I also agree with all his policies .
9,0,6,That ' s great !
10,0,6,I know he ' s going to be the next President .
11,0,6,Hopefully  he will be .
12,0,6,I can ' t wait to vote .

 (6, 6),(7, 6),(7, 7),(12, 10),(12, 11),(12, 12),
1,6,6,Do you have any shoes like these ?
2,6,6,What size ?
3,6,6,Size five .
4,6,6,What colour ?
5,6,6,Black .
6,1,6,I ' m sorry . We don't haven any .
7,3,6,But my sister bought this pair last month .
8,6,6,Did she buy them here ?
9,6,6,No  she bought them in the U . S .
10,6,6,We had some shoes like those a month ago  but we don't have any now .
11,6,6,Can you get a pair for me please ?
12,1,6,I ' m afraid that I can ' t . They were in fashion last year and the year before last . But they ' re not in fashion this year . These shoes are in fashion now .
13,6,6,They look very uncomfortable .
14,6,6,They are very uncomfortable . But women always wear uncomfortable shoes !

 (2, 1),(9, 1),(9, 9),(9, 9),(10, 10),(10, 10),
1,6,6,Our company is going to do some cutbacks soon .
2,3,6,Really ? Where did you hear that ?
3,6,6,I met with the supervisor just this morning . I don't know  but I am a little worried . Who do you think will get sacked ?
4,6,6,I'm not sure ... well  first  it couldn't be George . He is such a kiss-ass . He'd wash the boss's dog if he asked .
5,6,6,No  it's not going to be George . I don't think it's Andy either . He is involved with the boss's sister in-law . And you know how whipped our boss is .
6,6,6,That's true . What about Lisa ? I bet there's nobody who could do a worse job than her .
7,6,6,Lisa ? No way . I've heard a rumor that she and the boss were having an affair . You know rumors can't come out from nowhere .
8,6,6,Well  okay . Then there is still Michael . But he's the boss ' pet after having the best sales record for three months in a row . It definitely won't be Michael .
9,1,6,No  that would be crazy . But then who will it be ? Oh dear  it must be me . I should have known it ! Why else would he have talked to me alone about the downsizing . What should I do ? I've got a family to support .
10,1,6,Well  it could be me too . But I am not too worried . This place is suffocating me with this boss being such a hard-ass and colleagues who barely know how to get dressed in the morning . It would almost be a blessing to be fired from this place .
8640 16
 (2, 2),(4, 2),(4, 4),(9, 9),(11, 10),
1,6,6,Wow ! They've got everything here . All the world's famous brands . Aunt Cindy  what is your favorite brand ?
2,0,6,I love all the fashionable things . But my favorite brand is Chanel .
3,6,6,Oh  that's a very expensive brand  but with good reason .
4,0,6,Yeah . Each style is specially designed by world's top designers . So they can always make you look amazing .
5,6,6,I see . Come here . The high heels here look really attractive . But I wonder whether it's comfortable to wear any of them ?
6,6,6,Not really  especially at the beginning  if you wear high heels all day long  your feet would hurt . But  no big deal . Women can always get used to that .
7,6,6,It's not a simple thing to be beautiful .
8,6,6,Sure . But everyone loves to be beautiful . Hey  do you think this pair of sunglasses matches the handbag well ?
9,3,6,Yeah  very tasteful . And with them  you look even more fashionable . Oh  there are so many French perfumers . Oops  perfumes for guys ? So strange !
10,6,6,Come on . Fashion is not only for women . Men also share the equal right to chase fashion . It's the new fashion for men to wear perfumes  which is called cologne .
11,3,6,Oh  really  that's really something new . I'm afraid not everyone can accept it .
12,6,6,It takes time for that . But people's consuming attitudes are changing quickly .
13,6,6,That's true . Well  it's obvious that fashion is not a cheap thing . So  do you spend all your money on it ?
14,6,6,No . Fashion is just part of my life  which improves its quality . But also  I'm good at financing . I have a credit card  but I never overdraft .
15,6,6,How is it that you are my mom's sis ? You two are so different . She always picks up bargains and spends more than she earns . You do so much better than her .
16,6,6,I have to say that's just the result of difference of our consumptive habits .

 (1, 1),(2, 1),(3, 1),(3, 3),(4, 3),(4, 4),(5, 4),
1,0,6,Happy birthday  Jim !
2,0,6,Thank you  Lisa .
3,0,6,Here is a present for you . I hope you like it .
4,3,6,Oh  great ! I love it ! You know I've been expecting this for a long time .
5,0,6,I'm very glad to hear that .
6,6,6,Come here  let me introduce some friends to you .
847 13
 (3, 2),(5, 4),(7, 6),(8, 6),(9, 6),(9, 9),(10, 6),
1,6,6,What happened ? Why didn't he win ?
2,6,6,Didn't you hear ? He was disqualified .
3,3,6,How did that happen ? He's so talented ! I thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal !
4,6,6,If he didn't have any drug problems  he would have won .
5,3,6,What ? What kind of drugs was he using ?
6,6,6,He was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster .
7,2,6,I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs .
8,2,6,They are . The only reason they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards .
9,2,6,That's so disappointing . I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs .
10,2,6,I don't think it's right  but I can understand why they might . Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country !
11,6,6,Regardless of how much pressure you're under  there's never a good reason to take drugs .
12,6,6,I agree . Hopefully with the new regulations  fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs .
13,6,6,Let's hope so .
9643 16
 (1, 1),(7, 7),(8, 7),(9, 8),(9, 9),(10, 9),(10, 10),(16, 15),(16, 16),
1,3,6,Sis  why did you ask me to come to this bargain market ? It's so crowded  and you can't find anything that you really want .
2,6,6,You just don't get it . Looking for bargains can be really interesting .
3,6,6,Are you serious ? How can that be ?
4,6,6,Bargaining is a game  or even a battle . You feel like a winner when you get a good price .
5,6,6,Come on . You know  you can never really win . The salesperson never loses . They make their living out of it .
6,6,6,That's true . But I just love it . Come here !
7,0,6,Oh  this silk carpet is really beautiful . Look at the pattern  and how delicate it is !
8,0,6,You do have great taste . That's the most expensive stuff here .
9,0,6,Really ? Oh  this one . I like the cloisonn vase .
10,0,6,Are you kidding me ? I bought a same one last week . It's surprising that there is something we both like . Well  what do you think of these ceramic cups ?
11,6,6,Come on . They look so cheap . Something else  please .
12,6,6,What about this picture ? I think Benjamin would like it .
13,6,6,Don't underestimate his taste . I don't think he'd like it .
14,6,6,Don't be so sure . He loves the vase I bought here last week .
15,6,6,Yeah . Well  anyway  it's up to you . But I can tell that you come here often .
16,0,6,Absolutely . That's why I can always get a good price .
10488 10
 (3, 3),(4, 3),(4, 4),(8, 7),(8, 8),(8, 8),
1,6,6,Hey George  how is your chicken ?
2,6,6,My chicken tastes all right  but it is pretty dry . How is your fish ?
3,1,6,My fish is pretty dry too .
4,1,6,It's almost as if this food has been sitting a little too long . It doesn't seem fresh .
5,6,6,Yes  it seems that way to me also .
6,6,6,How are your vegetables ?
7,6,6,My vegetables are very soggy .
8,1,6,Mine are the same way . It seems like they've been overcooked .
9,6,6,I don't usually complain  but I think that we should mention this to the waiter .
10,6,6,I agree . Maybe they can bring us some better food .
10373 14
 (5, 5),(8, 8),(11, 11),(13, 11),
1,6,6,How do you want your hair cut ?
2,6,6,I want it the way Peckham wears it .
3,6,6,Who is Peckham ?
4,6,6,Are you kidding me ? Even the girls know Peckham . Whatever  I have a picture of him here .
5,0,6,You are a big fan of him ! He has strong legs .
6,6,6,Sure  he is a soccer star .
7,6,6,Hey  wake up . It's done . How do you like it ?
8,5,6,Oh  my God . It's disaster . It makes my head look like a soccer ball .
9,6,6,But it's the same hairstyle .
10,6,6,It looks like the hairstyle of Kahn who stands beside him in the picture .
11,1,6,Oh . I made a mistake . I thought the guy on the right was Peckham .
12,6,6,He plays outside right but it doesn't mean he has to stand on the right .
13,1,6,Sorry  but do not worry . I think I can fix it . Just cut a little more off the temple .
14,6,6,Do it  please .
672 12
 (6, 4),(8, 4),(8, 7),(10, 4),(10, 7),(12, 11),
1,6,6,Oh  hi  Jessica  are you going to see this movie too ?
2,6,6,I'd love to  the movies are smash hit .
3,6,6,Then let's go in .
4,6,6,I can't . I'm waiting for Paul  but he's late .
5,6,6,I'll say the movie's starting in the minute .
6,1,6,I know . I wonder what's keeping him .
7,6,6,Looks like he won't show up . He's done this before  hasn't he ?
8,1,6,Yeah  a number of times .
9,6,6,What's he trying to pull anyway .
10,1,6,I don't know . But this is definitely the last straw .
11,6,6,Maybe you should start seeing someone else .
12,0,6,You said it . Ok  let's go in  Sandy .
10408 12
 (7, 6),(8, 7),(10, 6),(12, 6),
1,6,6,Hello . I am calling about the apartment you advertised .
2,6,6,Yes  what kind of apartment are you interested in ?
3,6,6,I am interested in one-bedroom . Do you have any available ?
4,6,6,Yes  I have one . When you need it ?
5,6,6,Sometime around next week . What can you tell me about this apartment ?
6,6,6,Well  It's a one-bedroom apartment . The monthly rent at 650 dollars and a 300 dollars security deposit . You pay electricity only . Gas and water is included . Both the heat and stove are gas . Let me see  what else ... Oh  you'll be assigned a sheltered parking space at no extra charge . And that's probably it .
7,0,6,Sounds good . May I come over tomorrow to take a look ?
8,0,6,Sure . What time would you like to come ?
9,6,6,How about 10 am ?
10,0,6,Good  May I have your name  please ?
11,6,6,My name is Blanca .
12,0,6,Thanks for calling  Blanca . I'll see you tomorrow .

 (4, 4),(5, 5),(6, 4),(6, 6),(6, 6),
1,6,6,Look  Jim . That man just fell down over there .
2,6,6,We'd better see if he is ok .
3,6,6,Sir  sir  are you all right  sir ?
4,4,6,He is not answering . You'd better check his pulse and breathing .
5,3,6,Oh  no . He is not breathing and there ' s no pulse . Call 911 .
6,4,6,Hello ? Yes  someone has passed out at Dongle Ave . and 2nd street . He isn't breathing and doesn't have a pulse . Yes  my friend is performing CPR . Ok  thank you . They are sending an ambulance . Here  let me help .

1,0,6,You bet it is . And we got four thousand for our car space ! Awesome !
2,0,6,Let's play some music ! I feel like dancing .
3,0,6,That's just what was running through my mind . Moonlight and dancing .
4,0,6,Ahh ! Now that's more like it . Atmosphere !
5,0,6,Come on baby  let's dance !
6,3,6,Oops ! It's the landlord . I guess the tables have turned now . We're the noisy neighbors . Turn it down !

1,6,6,Hi  I come to pick up my laundry . This is the invoice .
2,6,6,Here you are . We've ironed them for you already . Please check and see if there is any damage .
3,6,6,I'm afraid that a button is missing .
4,1,6,I'm terribly sorry . You know we are so busy today and we forget to sew the button back on . Please wait a moment . It will be ready soon .
5,6,6,OK  please .
6,6,6,Would you like to have a look ? Is it to your satisfaction ?
7,3,6,Well  oh my God  there is another problem  I'm afraid . There is still a stain on the shirt .
8,1,6,It doesn't seem like that . Sorry  sir  we've tried everything  but we're not able to get it off the shirt . It was from the sugar I think .
9,6,6,It's been several days now  I am not sure .
10,6,6,Yes  the sugar was burnt during the dry-cleaning process . And there you go .
11,6,6,Oh  that's so bad . I know little about that . Is there a remedy for it ?
12,1,6,I am awfully sorry . Please tell us about the stains before the dry-cleaning next time .
13,6,6,OK  I will .
14,6,6,This is a membership card . You can get a 20 percent discount next time .
15,0,6,Thanks a lot .
16,0,6,Hope to see you again . We will provide the best service .

1,0,6,I enjoy the folk song and dance show very much .
2,0,6,I'm glad you appreciate our folk music . But a live performance is much more interesting .
3,6,6,I can't wait anymore . When does the performance start ?
4,6,6,The show starts at 7 and is over at around 10 o'clock p . m .
5,6,6,( After the show ) It's an excellent musical . The acting was very expressive and the songs and dancing were superb .
6,0,6,I'm glad you enjoyed it . It's had long run  but the house has always been full .
7,6,6,What do you think of the leading actors ?
8,0,6,Personally I liked the main character . He was true to type .
9,6,6,You are a better judge . I don't know the play well enough .
9626 14
 (2, 1),(2, 1),(7, 6),(9, 1),(9, 1),(14, 6),
1,6,6,Hi  I'm back ! Hmm ... your hair is pretty damaged  and you've got split ends .
2,3,6,Really ? What can I do ?
3,6,6,Well  the trim should fix the split ends  but you might need a deep conditioning treatment .
4,6,6,Umm  OK . Whatever you think will help .
5,6,6,I'm also going to add some layers to frame your face .
6,6,6,Can you use the thinning shears on top  too ? My hair is really thick .
7,0,6,No problem !
8,6,6,Hi  I'm back ! Hmm ... your hair is pretty damaged  and you've got split ends .
9,3,6,Really ? What can I do ?
10,6,6,Well  the trim should fix the split ends  but you might need a deep conditioning treatment .
11,6,6,Umm  OK . Whatever you think will help .
12,6,6,I'm also going to add some layers to frame your face .
13,6,6,Can you use the thinning shears on top  too ? My hair is really thick .

8,1,6,That's terrible .
9,6,6,I am sorry to say this  sir  but you should've been more careful .
10,1,6,I apologize for that . But the space is too small .
11,6,6,What about the damage to my car ? What are you gonna do about that ?
12,6,6,Can we solve this later ? I am calling the insurance company .

1,6,6,Are you OK ?
2,1,6,I'm fine . I'm just so touched by the sad story .
3,6,6,So I can say now that you must have enjoyed the opera . Which scene is your favorite ?
4,6,6,I love them all . But if I had to name one as the best  I would say it's the ending .
5,6,6,What's it about ? You know  I couldn't help falling asleep .
6,3,6,Did you ? I didn't notice that . But still you should know it  for you have seen it with Laura before .
7,6,6,I guess I've done the same thing last time I was here with her  too . I mean falling asleep . For me  this one is not that attractive .
8,6,6,Then I doubt if you like operas at all .
9,6,6,Yes . I like Carmen very much . But I don't mind if you want to tell me about this one .
10,6,6,OK  then . The man was old and he was visiting his wife's grave  with a rose in his hand . When he got there  he saw someone already put a rose on her grave .
11,0,6,Very impressive . And I do like the leading actress who has an amazing voice .
12,0,6,Me  too . There was always a good round of applause every time she sings .
13,0,6,Yes  the applause ! That was what kept waking me up during the show .
14,0,6,And it's been such a faultless performance with the perfect lighting  and music . Just amazing !
15,0,6,No doubt  it's not a simple thing to put on a ' phantom show ' .
16,0,6,Exactly .

1,5,6,Ah ! No ! Damn it !
2,6,6,It's a blackout . Now I can't see Seinfeld .
3,6,6,So what ? I just lost one hour's worth of work .
4,3,6,Really ? How could you do that ? Don't you save every couple minutes ?
5,5,6,No  I didn't save this time . Damn it ! And I'm sick of writing this paper . Now I have to write it all over again too .
6,6,6,I've had that problem too many times . So I learned to save . When I'm writing something  I save every three sentences or so . I don't want to lose anything .
7,6,6,I hate computers . Sometimes I think they cause more trouble than they're worth .
8,6,6,What are we going to do now ?
9,6,6,I don't know . I feel like going out .
10,6,6,I wonder how much of the city is down .
11,6,6,It doesn't matter . I still can go out and buy a beer .
12,6,6,Maybe . But if there's a blackout  probably the pubs are closed . And besides  I know you have a political science exam tomorrow . I thought you had a lot of reading to do .
13,5,6,Yes  that's true . Damn ! I just lost half my paper  and now I can't even do my homework . This is a bad time for this to happen .
14,6,6,I have a flashlight in my closet . If you want to use that to read  you can .
15,0,6,Thanks . I think I will try . Where are you going ?
16,6,6,I like your idea of getting a beer . I think I'll go out myself .
17,6,6,Maybe we can trade . Why don't you stay here and read for my exam  and I'll go drink beer ?
18,6,6,No  it just won't work . If I read for your exam  you won't know the answers tomorrow . I will .
19,6,6,So ? You can go to the class for me . Just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . Why not ?
20,6,6,How many students are in the class ?
21,6,6,About fourteen .
22,6,6,So it won't work  old buddy . They'll see that I'm not you . Sorry .

4,3,6,Why ? You are so excellent . I think you are the most suitable person for the job .
5,6,6,Yes  I know I am excellent  but I pay no attention to the etiquette you ' Ve told me .
6,3,6,What ? Then what did you do ?
7,6,6,When I entered the room  I forgot to close the door . Later  I couldn ' t help smoking  you know I am a heavy-smoker . What ' s more  I forgot to polish my shoes . There is some dirt on it .
8,6,6,You are so careless . You know they are the basic rules you should follow before you attend an interview . Do remember not to smoke any more  otherwise  you can ' t find a job .
9,6,6,Yes  I know . And next time I must make good preparations .
10,6,6,Good luck next time .

2,6,6,Yes  and I want to buy the insurance too . I think it's necessary .
3,0,6,You're smart to buy it . At 45 dollars for three days  it is a good deal .
4,6,6,Can I return the car in San Francisco ?
5,6,6,San Francisco ? No  sir . We only have this office here . You will have to return it here .
6,3,6,Really ? I heard in America you can return rental cars in different cities .
7,6,6,No  sir . That's only with the very big companies . I'm sorry  but this car must be returned to this lot .
8,6,6,Well  I guess I will have to drive back down then . Hmm . I didn't think of that .

3,6,6,All right . If you need any help  just let me know . My name is Greg .
4,0,6,Sure  I'll let you know if I need anything . Hm  this mattress is very firm . Jack will probably like it .
5,6,6,Did you find something you like ?
6,0,6,Yes  this mattress is very good . It's pretty firm . The mattress I ' m now sleeping on is saggy .
7,6,6,You are right . This is very good brand . It doesn't sag easily and we offer a lifetime warranty  so you don't have to worry about its quality .
8,6,6,Does it come with a frame ?
9,6,6,Unfortunately  it doesn't . However we can give you a 10 % discount on the frame . We also offer a very good financing plan . There is no payment no interest until next June .
10,0,6,That's an attractive plan . I'll think about it .

1,0,6,Thank you for coming tonight  Mrs . Webber . As a teacher  it's great seeing the kid's parents assist our parent-teacher conference night .
2,0,6,Of course ! I am very interested to know how my child is doing and also get some insight from you as to how he can improve .
3,0,6,Well Allen is a great student . He is a hard worker and very well behaved  however he does struggle a bit with math .
4,6,6,I guess he gets that from me  I never did well in math when I was a kid . What can I do at home to compliment what he is learning in the classroom .
5,6,6,Well  it's important that you sit with him and review his homework assignments and help him with math . I would also recommend he stay after school twice a week for tutoring sessions . It will really help a lot .
6,0,6,Thanks a lot ! I will definitely do that . Is there anything else ?
7,6,6,Um ... yes . Here is a notice from our financial department  seems your child's Tumion is overdue .

1,6,6,Ah ! It hurts . Don't touch it .
2,6,6,What part hurts ?
3,6,6,The shoulder .
4,6,6,Well  maybe you broke it . But what I'm worried about is this cut .
5,4,6,It's not a cut . It's a gash ! It's bigger than a cut ! Ah ! I need a doctor .
6,6,6,C'mon . Just don't move .
7,4,6,I'm bleeding too much .
8,6,6,We don't have a decent First Aid Kit  do we ?
9,4,6,Yes . My bike has one under the seat . Get it  quick !
10,6,6,There's some tape  iodine  and cloth bandages . I don't think the cloth bandages can stop the bleeding . What we need is a tourniquet .
11,6,6,Wrap a few loops of the bandages around my upper arm  then twist . That will work as a tourniquet . After that  you can cut more of the bandages to cover the wound .
12,0,6,Good plan . Let me put some iodine on the cut .
13,4,6,No  forget that ! Do the tourniquet first . I'm losing too much blood .
14,6,6,Alright  alright . How did you cut this so bad ?
15,5,6,I ran it against that fence pole as I crashed . What do you think ? Damn  it hurts !
16,6,6,We'll have to get you to a hospital . I can ride you on the back of my bike .
17,6,6,I'm lucky I wasn't killed . I must have been going around forty-five miles an hour . There was too much gravel on that corner . I slid out .
18,6,6,Yes  I almost slid too . Alright . This tourniquet is tight . How does it feel ?
19,6,6,Make it tighter . I want the blood stopped . Then wrap some bandages around the cut . Then we can go . Ouch ! I hope I can walk .
20,6,6,Alright  I'm twisting it around . You tell me when to stop .
21,6,6,There . Stop !

1,6,6,How do you arrange this summer vacation ?
2,6,6,I want to travel .
3,6,6,Where would you like to go ?

1,6,6,My friend Emily recently lost 18 pounds .
2,3,6,Oh  really ?
3,6,6,The point is that she has been persuading me to lose weight too .
4,6,6,Well  it's a good thing for you .
5,3,6,Good ? Yes  it's good for her but not for me . You see  she tells me that I'll feel better about myself if I slim down . She keeps giving me newspaper clippings about the latest miracle diet and insists that I join a health club  as she has .
6,3,6,So you don't think you are fat and need to lose weight ?
7,6,6,I just can't bear it that Emily made me feel like a baby who always pigs out on junk food .
8,6,6,junk food is not good for your health . Too much of it will make you fat .
9,6,6,But junk food is so easy . It requires no silverware or plates  no rigid mealtimes  no pleases and thank yous .
10,6,6,Ok  but junk food has many disadvantages . As junk food contains high amount of oil and fat  you'll feel sleepy  but not be able to concentrate when you have a lot of it .
11,6,6,Yes  but life without chips  ice cream and coca cola is boring .
12,6,6,Let me see . You could exercise more to keep fit .
13,6,6,Well  that sounds better than giving it up .
891 11
 (4, 3),(9, 9),(11, 10),
1,6,6,Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ?
2,6,6,Sorry  I thought you knew .
3,6,6,But you should tell me you were in love with her .
4,3,6,Didn't I ?
5,6,6,You know you didn't .
6,6,6,Well  I am telling you now .
7,6,6,Yes  but you might have told me before .
8,6,6,I didn't think you would be interested .
9,5,6,You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you are going to marry her ?
10,6,6,Sorry  I didn't think it mattered .
11,5,6,Oh  you men ! You are all the same .

8,0,6,No  I have visited China several times  but it's my first visit to Beijing and I think it's a great honor to be invited to your beautiful city .

9,6,6,We have this beautiful platinum pendant  or you could also get her a locket . You could also get her a timepiece -- it ' s both glamorous yet functional . If you tell me a little more about your girlfriend  maybe I can help you find something for her .
10,6,6,Jess ? Well  she ' s very smart  and has a great sense of humor . She ' s very feminine ...
11,6,6,Perhaps you could give her a ring ?
12,6,6,Well ... actually ... I was thinking about asking Jess to marry me ... I ' Ve just been so nervous .
13,0,6,Well sir  I believe your fifth anniversary is a great time to propose !
14,0,6,Okay  I ' Ve decided . I ' m going to pop the question !
15,0,6,Fabulous ! We should look at engagement rings then ! Now that ' s a whole other section .

1,0,6,Oh  hey  Keri ! You cook  right ! You're a pretty good cook .
2,6,6,I'm OK .
3,6,6,I want to make an omelet  so actually this is really silly  I've never made one before . How do you make an omelet ?
4,6,6,Well  I can teach you how I make them  which is the same way my father and grandmother make them  which is a little special .
5,0,6,OK . Yeah ! Yeah !
6,6,6,First you take some eggs and crack them in a bowl  and whisk them up  quite  so they're quite high and fluffy  and in a hot pan  and you need a pan that's that's kind of small  that the sides go up at an angle . You put some oil and heat it up  so it's quite hot  and then you take your whipped up eggs  or whisked up eggs  and pour them into the pan  and as it's cooking  if you take a spatula  and push the bottom layer of the egg  to the side  to the sides  and then to the middle  so the uncooked egg gets to the bottom of the pan .
7,0,6,Oh  OK . Wow !
8,6,6,OK . And keep doing that until most of the egg is cooked so you should have a nice thick omelet and then flip it over  you'll only have to cook that side lightly . Put your fillings on the top and fold it over and let it sit just long enough to melt the cheese .
9,0,6,Wow . That sounds really good .

 (1, 1),(4, 4),(8, 8),(10, 10),(11, 10),(11, 11),

2,6,6,Beauty costs  dear ! What do you think of this dress ? Do you think it suits me ?
3,6,6,yeah  it's lovely  but to be frank  it's not the most practical . You don't have many formal events in your calendar  do you ?
4,0,6,come on  you sound like my Mom . Look at that  it's beautiful !
5,6,6,when you buy clothes  you must think about the material  quality and price .
6,6,6,maybe you have a point .
7,6,6,make sure you buy what you need and your clothes can be worn for various occasions .
8,0,6,all right . How about this black shirt ? It can be worn for anything---a party  a job interview and even a funeral !
9,6,6,that's true  but you already have two back coats and one black sweater .
10,0,6,oh ! Hey  look  that's the same shirt Britney wore in her concert .
11,0,6,exactly ! Oh  my god ! I love Britney ! I'm going to get it .
12,6,6,why not try it on ?
13,6,6,it's just the right size--a perfect fit ! I'll take it . Oh  no  I'm a little short . Did you bring your credit card ?
14,6,6,yes .
15,6,6,I promise I'll pay you back as soon as we get home .

2,1,6,My girlfriend just broke up with me .
3,6,6,You must feel terrible now .
4,1,6,Yeah .
5,6,6,I remember my first break up . It was the worst feeling in the world . I was crying everyday for three months . And slowly  it got better . I know you'll feel better too .
6,3,6,You've been through this too ?
7,6,6,Yeah . I remember it very clearly . The pain makes it easy to remember . I know you're really hurting right now  but you know many people experience break ups .
8,1,6,But it hurts too much .
9,6,6,I know it's painful  but it's only temporary . After the pain goes away  you'll find other girls .
10,6,6,What if I don't want to find another girl ?
11,6,6,You'll change your mind . Look at everyone in the world . They all break up and move on . The faster you understand this  the quicker you will recover .
12,0,6,You're right .
13,0,6,I also know you must still have strong feelings for her  but try to think of all the bad things . You know she didn't treat you that well . Is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with ?
14,0,6,Yeah . Thanks for the talk .
15,0,6,I'll give you a call later . We should hang out . It's good to be around people .

1,6,6,Why don't you watch where you're going ?
2,3,6,Me ? You're the one who pulled out in front of me !
3,6,6,There was plenty of room for me to pull out . You didn't have to stay in the lane you were in .
4,5,6,Hey  listen . I had every right to stay in the lane I was in . You were supposed to wait until I passed to pull out . And anyhow  you didn't give me any time to change lanes . All of a sudden--BANG--there you are right in front of me .
5,6,6,I think my arm is broken .
6,6,6,Sorry about your arm  but it serves you right . You need to learn how to drive . You're lucky you didn't get killed . And I'm lucky to be alive too .
7,6,6,Listen  let's just wait until the police get here . Then we can decide whose fault this accident was .
8,6,6,Fine with me . I know the laws of the road . I'm not worried .
9,6,6,I have a cell phone in my car . Now it's probably on the floor on the passenger side . Why don't you get it for me  and then I can call the police ?
10,6,6,Alright .
11,6,6,It doesn't work . It looks like it's broken . I need to get to a hospital . You should drive me there .
12,3,6,Oh  yeah ? It's better if we make a police report first . Then you can go to the hospital .
13,5,6,Damn it ! I'm injured here . We could wait all day for the police .
14,6,6,Well  you'll just have to wait . I'm not going to move my car until the police arrive . I'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone . Don't worry . You'll get to the hospital in time .
15,6,6,It really hurts .
16,6,6,Yes  maybe it does . But if you're going to drive like you did just now  you will have to get used to a little physical pain . You know what I mean ?
17,5,6,To hell with you . The accident was your fault .
18,6,6,I'm afraid it wasn't . And when the police get here  you will also see that it wasn't . But enough of this bickering . I'm going to go find a phone . Don ' t move that arm while I'm gone . Alright ?
19,5,6,To hell with you .

1,3,6,Look ! Allen has the mic !
2,6,6,I thought he only liked to listen !
3,3,6,That was before he heard Stanley sing ! I guess he couldn't stand it any more  so he decided to give it a try himself !

2,0,6,Sure ! What do you feel like having ?
3,0,6,I really feel like having a big juicy steak !
4,6,6,Oh . OK . I don't eat meat  but that's fine  I am sure wherever we are going they will have other options right ?
5,3,6,I didn't know you were a vegetarian !
6,6,6,I'm not  I am a vegan .
7,3,6,A what ?
8,6,6,A vegan . I don't eat or use any animal based products . I don't wear leather  eat eggs  drink milk or anything that comes from an animal . I used to be a pescatarian before  which basically means you don't eat meat  but still have fish and seafood .
9,0,6,Wow ! That's interesting ! It must be tough !
10,6,6,It's a bit difficult to find vegetarian friendly restaurants sometimes  but since more and more people are vegetarians or vegans nowadays  it's getting a bit less difficult .

2,0,6,yeah  I'm glad that we didn't have to wait long . I'm starving !
3,6,6,let's take a look at the menu so we can order . Do you want to choose an appetizer for us to share ?
4,6,6,what would you rather have  samosas or poppadoms ?
5,6,6,I heard that one of their specialities is the samosa .
6,6,6,well  let's get a plate of those then .
7,6,6,sounds good . What are you going to have for your main course ?
8,6,6,I think I might have a dahl .
9,6,6,what's in a dahl ?
10,6,6,it's got chickpeas and vegetables in a spicy curry sauce with rice .
11,0,6,that sounds nice . Do you want to share some kebabs as well ?
12,6,6,ok . How about some lamb kebabs ?
13,0,6,that's my favourite . Do you want to have some wine or beer ?
14,6,6,I think I'll have a beer .
15,6,6,ok  shall I flag down the waitress ?
16,6,6,I wouldn't recommend it . I think we should wait until she comes round .
17,0,6,you're right . That might seem a bit rude . It's a good thing I've got you with me !
18,6,6,what would you do without me ?

2,6,6,I ' m sorry  we have no mid-size available at the moment .
3,6,6,I don ' t understand  I made a reservation  do you have my reservation ?
4,6,6,Yes  we do  unfortunately we ran out of cars .
5,5,6,But the reservation keeps the car here . That ' s why you have the reservation .
6,6,6,I know why we have reservations .
7,5,6,I don ' t think you do . If you did  I ' d have a car . See  you know how to take the reservation  you just don ' t know how to hold the reservation and that ' s really the most important part of the reservation  the holding . Anybody can just take them .
8,6,6,But we do have a compact or an SUV if you ' d like .
9,5,6,Fine . I ' ll take the compact .
10,6,6,Alright . We have a blue Ford Focus for you  Mr . Fox . Would you like insurance ?

4,6,6,Anything that distracts you from work ?
5,1,6,Yes  everything . I feel overwhelmed by the daily work . Sometimes  I just can ' t focus on what I am doing . What is worse  though I make plans for a whole week  I always have to make changes later on because other things come up . I can ' t manage my time well . I can ' t handle work well . I am afraid I was screw up more things .
6,6,6,Look  Lucy . Things are not so bad as you said . This is our company ' s busiest time in a year . You need to relax a little . Don ' t push yourself too hard  ok ?

1,6,6,Hi  Dan . What's new ?
2,6,6,Where have you been ? I've been trying to get in touch with you for two days .
3,6,6,I went to Salt Lake City on business . What's up ?
4,1,6,I got fired .
5,3,6,How come ? Last time I saw you . You told me it was a good job  and you'd like to take it as a career . That was only one month ago . Why this sudden change ?
6,1,6,It's a long story . In a word  I didn't do a good job of it . I messed up a business deal  a deal that would have made ten million dollars and I messed it up .
7,6,6,What are you going to do now ?
8,6,6,I am trying to find a job asap . Lily doesn't know yet . I didn't tell her . I spent the past three days at the coffee shop next to your office  and she thought I went to work as usual .
9,6,6,That's not the way to solve the problem . Did you look in the classified advertisements column ?
10,6,6,Yes  I did . But I wasn't qualified for most of the jobs that I was interested in .
11,6,6,Listen . I will see what I can do  ok ? You go home and tell Lily about this problem you have now . She is your wife and I am sure she will understand .
12,1,6,I just don't know how to bring it up . Well  all right . She has the right to know anyways .

2,0,6,Wow  fantastic . I like the font and color for his name . It is creative yet personal .
3,0,6,Yes  it is a bold design . People will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . It just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .
4,0,6,I agree . Business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . It won ' t take much time to design an amazing card  but it can make a big difference among the crowd . And you ' ll always notice it from your collection . For they have outspoken colors  own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . I wish to have one like this . But for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow .

4,6,6,I just sense . But I cannot grow anymore . My boss is not really supporting me . I am interested in some positions in other JV companies  but I need to do some more in-depth research before I send my application letters out .
5,0,6,That is important . Doing research on a company you are interested in will definitely help your application .

5,6,6,let's see how much the bill is .
6,6,6,don't worry about it . Tonight is my treat .
7,6,6,what are you talking about ? We'll split the bill .
8,6,6,no  I insist . I kept telling you that I would treat you to dinner but I still haven't .
9,6,6,no way  Gordon . I know that you are a little short on cash at the moment . There's no need for you to pay for the whole bill .
10,6,6,alright  if that's the way you are going to be  we'll split the bill .
11,6,6,that's better . This way we will both have money to take a cab home  otherwise  you would probably have to walk .
12,6,6,just promise you will let me treat you to dinner next week  ok ?

2,6,6,Me ? You're the one who pulled out in front of me !
3,5,6,There was plenty of room for me to pull out . You didn't have to stay in the lane you were in .
4,6,6,Hey  listen . I had every right to stay in the lane I was in . You were supposed to wait until I passed to pull out . And anyhow  you didn't give me any time to change lanes . All of a sudden--BANG--there you are right in front of me .
5,6,6,I think my arm is broken .
6,6,6,Sorry about your arm  but it serves you right . You need to learn how to drive . You're lucky you didn't get killed . And I'm lucky to be alive too .
7,6,6,Listen  let's just wait until the police get here . Then we can decide whose fault this accident was .
8,6,6,Fine with me . I know the laws of the road . I'm not worried .
9,6,6,I have a cell phone in my car . Now it's probably on the floor on the passenger side . Why don't you get it for me  and then I can call the police ?
10,6,6,Alright .
11,5,6,It doesn't work . It looks like it's broken . I need to get to a hospital . You should drive me there .
12,6,6,Oh  yeah ? It's better if we make a police report first . Then you can go to the hospital .
13,5,6,Damn it ! I'm injured here . We could wait all day for the police .
14,6,6,Well  you'll just have to wait . I'm not going to move my car until the police arrive . I'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone . Don't worry . You'll get to the hospital in time .
15,5,6,It really hurts .
16,6,6,Yes  maybe it does . But if you're going to drive like you did just now  you will have to get used to a little physical pain . You know what I mean ?
17,5,6,To hell with you . The accident was your fault .
18,6,6,I'm afraid it wasn't . And when the police get here  you will also see that it wasn't . But enough of this bickering . I'm going to go find a phone . Don ' t move that arm while I'm gone . Alright ?
19,5,6,To hell with you .

1,6,6,Hi Barbara . Have you lost weight ?
2,6,6,Hi Julie . Yeah . I've been on a diet for a couple of months now .
3,6,6,Wow . You look great .
4,0,6,Thanks for noticing .
5,6,6,What type of diet were you on ?
6,6,6,I joined a health club and my trainer gave me tips on eating . With a combination of eating better and exercising  I managed to lose 15 pounds in 2 months .
7,0,6,That's amazing . What tips did your trainer give you ?
8,6,6,Mostly on how to exercise  but the best advice I got was changing my eating habits . Instead of eating 3 times a day  she told me to eat 5 times a day .
9,6,6,That doesn't make sense . If you eat more  than how do you lose weight ?
10,6,6,Actually  I'm eating the same amount . I eat 5 smaller meals a day . Basically  it naturally speeds up the metabolism and helps to burn fat at a faster rate .
11,6,6,That makes sense . I'm going to try that .
12,6,6,You don't need to lose weight .
13,6,6,I have a little gut I have been trying to get rid of .
14,6,6,Ah ... but remember to incorporate a little exercise into your diet .
15,0,6,Thanks for the advice .

3,6,6,Why ? Looks like you're feeling very down ! What happened ?
4,1,6,Nothing .
5,6,6,Come on . For a man who's feeling so  down  there're usually two reasons . Either his career is going downhill  or he has a broken heart . Since you're so successful  it must be the latter .
6,1,6,Well  you're right . I just broke up with Jane .
7,6,6,Oh  I'm sorry . I thought you two were made for each ocher .
8,1,6,Well  you never know . I'm ready for a commitment and want to settle down  but she says she wants to pursue her career while she's still young .
9,6,6,Well  she is not to blame . It's always difficult to choose between career and family .
10,1,6,Maybe you're right .
11,6,6,Jack  I don't know what to say to comfort you  but cheer up ! There are plenty of fish in the sea and you'll find your soul mate  your perfect match !

4,6,6,Oh  I think it is .
5,6,6,How come ?
6,5,6,I think it's because of your bad habits !
7,6,6,I have no bad habit . I sleep eight hours a day  never eat spicy food  clean the face twice a day and so on . I have done a lot .
8,6,6,I know you have done a lot  but you always sleep very late . Sleeping eight hours a day doesn't mean it is healthy . Sleeping after 12 is hurtful to our body  and I think this is your problem .
9,3,6,I wasn't aware of that !
10,6,6,You should do better later .

1,6,6,how was school today  Dominic ?
2,2,6,I hate school !
3,3,6,why ? What happened ?
4,2,6,I messed up my mid-term exam so badly today !
5,6,6,it's just one exam . Can you re-take the exam ?
6,2,6,yes  but it's so humiliating ! I don't want my friends to know I failed !
7,6,6,why didn't you do a good job ?
8,6,6,I don't know . I sat down in my seat  looked at my paper  and then my mind just went totally blank .
9,6,6,do you think you studied enough for the exam ?
10,6,6,no ...
11,6,6,what did you do last night ?
12,6,6,I watched TV .
13,6,6,did you study at all last night for your exam ?
14,6,6,no  not really .
15,6,6,I am sure if you had studied  you would have done well . When can you re-take your exam ?
16,6,6,tomorrow .
17,6,6,alright . Get out your books and I'll help you prepare .

3,6,6,What's the problem ?
4,2,6,My brother in-law just dropped in from the states .
5,6,6,Yeah  and ?
6,2,6,I decided to put him up while he's here  big mistake !
7,6,6,Why ?
8,2,6,He's lazy . I tried being a good host  but if you give him an inch  he'll take a mile .
9,6,6,I guess you think twice next time he comes .
10,6,6,You can say that again .
11,6,6,So how long has he here for ?
12,6,6,Two weeks . If he thinks I'll put up with his attitude that long he's got another thing coming .
13,6,6,Well  I know you do the right thing .

2,6,6,What am I doing ? What am I doing ? Don ' t you know what day it is ?
3,6,6,Mumm . no .
4,6,6,It ' s only the day when the world ' s biggest sporting event is kicking off .
5,6,6,What ?
6,0,6,The World Cup ! The first match is today ! It ' s Mexico vs . South Africa ! It ' s going to be a really good match ! Both teams have a very strong offense and have skilled players . I think that South Africa
7,3,6,I have no idea what you ' re talking about . The only sporting event we watch at home is the Super Bowl .
8,6,6,This is bigger than the Super Bowl  man ! Teams from 32 countries compete against each other every four years and fight to win that trophy . They first start in a group stage with bigger groups  each g
9,6,6,Sounds interesting  but soccer doesn ' t really appeal to me .
10,3,6,Are you kidding ? Over seven hundred million people watched the final match of the World Cup ! It ' s a very exciting and nerve wracking sport ! Each nation is cheering on their team  hoping they will bec
11,2,6,All I know about soccer is that you can ' t use your hands and that players are always falling down  trying to get a free kick or penalty kick . It seems like a sissy sport to me !

1,6,6,do you remember where you were for the terrorist attacks on 9-11 ?
2,6,6,yes  I was in my apartment in Beijing . Where were you ?
3,6,6,I was at home with my parents in New York City .
4,6,6,really ? Did you see the hijacked planes crash into and destroy the twin towers ?
5,6,6,I didn't see the crash itself  but I did see the smoke and everything afterwards from my parents ' apartment building .
6,6,6,that must have been horrible . Did you go out at all that day to see what was going on ?
7,6,6,no  we decided to stay in our apartment . With all the buses out of service and the underground trains at a halt  many people had no choice but to walk home . It was utter chaos .
8,6,6,did you know anyone who worked in the World Trade Center ?
9,6,6,yes  my uncle's firm had an office in one of the towers .
10,6,6,did he survive ?
11,1,6,unfortunately  he wasn't able to evacuate in time . He ended up dying in the tower .
12,1,6,I'm sorry . That must have really been a nightmarish day for you and your family .
13,5,6,it was . The hijackers didn't have any respect for human life not even their own .
14,6,6,terrorist acts are deliberate and deadly and can affect every walk of life .

1,6,6,Can I help you ?
2,6,6,I hope so . I'm looking for some material for a paper I'm writing  and I'm not quite sure where to look .
3,6,6,I'll certainly try to help you . What topic is your paper on ?
4,6,6,My paper is on the influence of television on children .
5,6,6,There are several possible sources you might use for that topic . I suggest you use the computer and the computer will give you a list of every scientific journal that talks about children and television .

4,6,6,It must be old .
5,6,6,At least more than 100 years old .
6,6,6,Let's enter it !
7,6,6,I can't open the door .
8,6,6,It must be locked .
9,6,6,Let me ask the old woman in that reception office .
10,6,6,She can't answer you .
11,6,6,She must be deaf .
12,6,6,It must be a haunted house . Are you frightened ?

3,0,6,So boring ! Shall we go out for a picnic with my friends ?
4,0,6,Sounds interesting . Who are the other people ?
5,0,6,Fred and David  my college class mates and Rachel .
6,0,6,Gorgeous ! What should I bring on that day ?
7,0,6,Your tent and enough food and water .
8,0,6,You mean  we can do many other things after the picnic  right ?
9,0,6,We can go fishing  chatting and camping .

4,6,6,I hope it stays nice like this for a long period of time .
5,6,6,Well  the weather is so unpredictable this time of year .
6,6,6,You're right . We don't know what is going to be like tomorrow .
7,3,6,Look ! It looks as if it is going to rain .

1,6,6,Did you hear what happened to Mike in Accounts ?
2,6,6,No . What ?
3,6,6,He got arrested on Friday night and spent the night in jail .
4,3,6,No . Really  what happened ?
5,6,6,Well  it was all a big mistake  actually . He got home on Friday night really late  and apparently he'd been out drinking with some clients  so he was really drunk .
6,6,6,Was he out with the guys from the bank ?
7,6,6,Yes  I think so .
8,6,6,Oh  yeah  they always get really drunk .
9,6,6,Well  anyway  he'd somehow lost his wallet and his house keys  so he couldn't get in . He lives alone  you know .
10,3,6,Oh  really . I thought he lived with his wife .
11,6,6,No  she left him last year .
12,3,6,Oh  really ? Do you know why ?
13,6,6,Hang on  let me finish telling you what happened . Where was I ?
14,6,6,He lost his wallet and keys .
15,6,6,Oh yes  well  he tried to climb in through the bathroom window  but apparently he slipped and broke the glass with his foot . The neighbors heard him and thought a robbery was in progress  so they called the police .
16,6,6,Oh  no .
17,6,6,Yes . So when the cops arrived  they didn't believe his story
18,6,6,So then what happened ?
19,6,6,Well  when he sobered up  he called someone from work to come and bail him out .
20,6,6,Well  that's a bit of a tricky situation .
21,6,6,Yes  I know .

2,6,6,Yes . Should we go there by bus so we aren't late ?
3,0,6,Actually  why don't we go there by bike ? We could get stuck in traffic if we travel by bus in rush hour .
4,0,6,That's true . Cycling is good for our environment  too . Let me just get my helmet then .
5,0,6,Is your helmet comfortable ?
6,0,6,Not really  but I liked the design  so I got it .
7,0,6,Maybe you should think about getting a round helmet ; they're better .
8,0,6,I'll think about it .
9,0,6,Is that your new bicycle ?
10,0,6,Yes  my father gave it to me for my birthday . Do you like it ?
11,0,6,It's the newest 10 speed cycling mountain bike . These are really expensive !
12,6,6,Nothing but the best from my dad . I like everything about it except for the brakes . They are a bit sticky .
13,6,6,I can fix those for you . Is there anything else wrong with it ?
14,6,6,Well  my saddle is too low for me . Do you know how to change the height ?
15,6,6,That's easy . It's important to have the saddle high enough so that your legs can extend fully when you are on your bicycle .
16,6,6,Is that why my knees have felt sore after every time I've ridden my bike ?
17,6,6,It's possible . Give me a minute and I can fix these for you and then we can go .

2,6,6,Cut what out I ' m not doing anything .
3,5,6,The tapping of your pen on your desk . It ' s driving me crazy .
4,5,6,Fine ! By the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !
5,5,6,I don ' t slurp my coffee . And plus  how can you hear it when you ' re shouting into your phone all the time ?
6,5,6,You ' Ve got to be kidding me ! You ' re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?
7,6,6,Look  we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions  and it ' s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . But  it ' s probably not a good idea to keep it up I ' m willing to forgive and forget and if you are .
8,6,6,Fine . Let's call a truce . I'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down .
9,6,6,Yeah  I ' ll try to do the same . So  I was wondering you wanna go out to dinner Friday night ?

2,6,6,What is it ? What happened ?
3,4,6,I think someone is stalking me .
4,3,6,No  it can't be . Really ? Who ?
5,4,6,I don't know . I saw him the first time Tuesday . He was at the cafe . I noticed he was looking at me a lot . Not just the usual looking  but staring . He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop .
6,6,6,What did you do ?
7,4,6,I didn't do anything . Finally  he left . But then I saw him again today . Outside the shoe store . Near the cafe . I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's . But then he came in too .
8,6,6,Did he leave when you left ?
9,6,6,Yes . Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . He was following me .
10,6,6,What did you do ?
11,4,6,He followed me all the way home !
12,6,6,That's about five blocks . And around corners too . So he was definitely following you .
13,4,6,Yes  he was . I'm not imagining it . Finally  just when I got home  I turned around and looked at him . He was just standing there . He didn't smile . He just stood there . It was so obvious . What should I do ? I'm so scared . Can I call the police ?
14,6,6,Actually  I don't think you can call the police . Not yet at least . He hasn't done anything . And probably the police will just ignore it . But if anything happens again  then maybe you should call .
15,4,6,Why can't I call the police now ? He was definitely following me !
16,6,6,Of course you can call the police if you want . That's not what I mean . I'm just saying that they probably won't do anything .
17,6,6,I suppose . What can they do ? I don't even know who he is .
18,6,6,Listen  Carol . Don't let this bother you too much . Probably it's nothing . Just keep your eyes open when you go out . If you see him a third time  and if he follows you again  then I think we should go to the police . But for now  just try not to worry .
19,6,6,Alright . And I won't go to that cafe for awhile .

4,6,6,Not at all . It ' s a piece of cake .

6,6,6,I could easily give you some time tomorrow night .

2,1,6,I don't think you really want to hear about it .
3,6,6,It can't have been that bad . Go on and tell me about it .
4,2,6,To be honest  it was horrible ! My manager is such a pain in the neck !
5,6,6,Why ? What happened ?
6,5,6,Well  he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them  my manager blamed them on me !
7,6,6,That's not very fair . What did you do ?
8,2,6,There wasn't really anything that I could do . There's always been a lot of bad blood between my manager and myself . If I had said anything  he would have fired me for sure .
9,6,6,Does he treat everyone in your department like this ?
10,5,6,He treats everyone pretty badly  but the way he treats me really takes the cake !
11,6,6,Do you have any idea why he treats you worse than the others ?
12,5,6,I really have no idea . All I know is that the thought of him really curls my hair !
13,6,6,Is there anyone else you can talk to about it at your company ?
14,6,6,Not really . I'm hoping to live with it for a while until I get a promotion .
15,6,6,That's very sensible . It sounds like you have a good head on your shoulders .
16,6,6,I try to be sensible about it  but it's not very easy . Sometimes you just have to grin and bear it .
17,6,6,That's so true . When you have a taste for success  you can't let dishonest people like your manager get in the way .

4,0,6,You big scrooge !
5,0,6,Hear me out . We can pool the money and give it to a family who could really use it !
6,6,6,But you may have some trouble convincing the kids .

3,0,6,The seats in the middle of this stadium are great  but they're already occupied by somebody else .
4,0,6,Oh  thank you for pointing that out . By the way  have you been following NBA for this season ?
5,6,6,Of course  tomorrow evening there will be a most exciting game .
6,6,6,Who plays who ?
7,6,6,Rockets vs Lakers . Yao Ming  my idol  will appear in front of several hundred million of the worldwide audience .
8,6,6,It's amazing . And when did he begin to play in the NBA ?
9,6,6,In 2002 . And since then he has attracted more attention than ever .
10,6,6,I can't consider you as a little kid any more . I know he is very tall .
11,6,6,Oh  you know something . He is 2 . 26 meters tall . But he is also nimble and skillful .
12,6,6,I also heard if a player has committed 5 fouls then he must be out of the game .
13,6,6,Yes  what's worse is he can't take any further part in the game .
14,6,6,That's really terrible . Oh  God  we forgot to cheer for Daddy .
15,6,6,Never mind . After all he is not so attractive as Yao Ming  right ?

7,0,6,That's a cool idea . At least it would be a surprise . But I'm afraid he wouldn't take care of it .
8,6,6,He would think you were crazy  Caroline .
9,6,6,Yes . An iguana is too strange for a gift  and a tie is too normal . So I have to find something halfway between .
10,6,6,How much do you want to spend ?
11,6,6,Well  he was very good to me . He helped me edit my essay for the scholarship contest . So I want to spend at least 75 dollars .
12,6,6,Alright  I have an idea . You know he carries that conservative-looking briefcase every day .
13,6,6,Yes .
14,6,6,Well  he isn't a lawyer  so I don't think he needs to have a briefcase like that .
15,6,6,What should he have then ?
16,6,6,I think he would appreciate having a very fine leather bag . But more like a workbag or shoulder bag . You know  not so hard and square like a briefcase .
17,0,6,I think that's a great idea . Men look great with that kind of bag . Where can we buy one ?
18,6,6,I don't think this mall has a leather goods store . So we have to go to State Street .
19,6,6,Alright . We can go later then .
20,6,6,We can buy something for Mom and Dad here  and then go buy Uncle Teddy's gift on State Street .
21,0,6,Good plan . What should we get for Mom though ?
22,6,6,She said she wants one of those automatic foot massagers . I think they sell them at Sears .
23,6,6,Alright . We can go check at Sears and see if they have them . And what about Dad ?
24,6,6,How about the iguana ?
25,6,6,I think it would be a great joke . But I know we'd have to take the iguana back . And the pet store might not let us . So why don't we get him something else ? Some clothes maybe .
26,6,6,A tie ?
27,5,6,Oh  shut up about ties ! Forget about ties  why not ?
28,6,6,I was just kidding .

1,0,6,I decided to give it a go !
2,0,6,Good for you . What items did you bid on ?
3,0,6,A DENY shirt and one of Serena Williams ' used tennis rackets !
4,0,6,Your idol ! Wow ! You're even better at finding stuff than me !
5,0,6,Yep . I placed a bid for the shirt . The minimum was ten so I bet fifty !
6,6,6,That's not how this game works .
7,6,6,Well  there was a sign that said " Buy now for seventy . "
8,6,6,How many bids had been placed before you ?

1,0,6,I think your speech was excellent .
2,6,6,Was it ?
3,0,6,Sure it was .
4,0,6,Thank you . It was really a challenge to speak before such a large audience  you know .
5,0,6,But you did it and did it well !
1566 19
 (1, 1),(3, 1),(3, 3),(10, 10),(14, 14),
1,5,6,Oh  my God ! I've been cheated !
2,6,6,What ? What did you buy ?
3,5,6,It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it !
4,6,6,What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ?
5,6,6,There was a guy on the sidewalk . He had three new boxes  Panasonic video camera boxes . He said he had to get rid of them quick .
6,6,6,And ?
7,6,6,So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks .
8,6,6,And it's a brick ?
9,6,6,Yes .
10,3,6,I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ?
11,6,6,I wanted to . But he said  no  the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store . If it's opened  other people won't believe it's new .
12,6,6,So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic .
13,6,6,Yes  it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products . Look  it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new .
14,3,6,But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ?
15,6,6,He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen .
16,6,6,Aha ! Now I understand . You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk . So  what I think is  you deserve to get cheated !
17,6,6,C'mon  don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it . We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box .
18,6,6,That's no problem . He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy . And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from . Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there . Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around . So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you . Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks .
19,6,6,You're right  Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ?
1975 12
 (1, 1),(2, 1),(2, 2),(6, 6),(7, 6),
1,0,6,Wow  the view from the peak is so grand !
2,0,6,Look  most of the maple leaves have turned red .
3,6,6,Did you ever see this kind of beautiful scene ?
4,6,6,Of course  my father used to take me to Kiang Shan or somewhere like that as a child .
5,6,6,But my father did not . He didn't have much time .
6,0,6,Honey  I'm sorry . I promise you  this summer vacation  I will take you to Huang-Shan Mountains . It is more beautiful and magnificent .
7,3,6,Really ? It's a deal . Have you ever been there ?
8,6,6,Yes  I went there five years ago . You were still a baby at that time .
9,6,6,It really gets me interested . Is it higher than Kiang Shan ?
10,6,6,Surely . You can enjoy the beauty of numerous streams and waterfalls . The sea of clouds has a fairy tale beauty .
11,6,6,Can I see the rainbow ?
12,6,6,That depends . If you are lucky  you can see a vivid rainbow across over two peaks .

4,5,6,Certainly not .
5,6,6,May I turn on the radio then ?
6,5,6,Turn on the radio ? What for ?
7,6,6,So that we can sit down together and listen to some music .
8,5,6,Listen to some music ? And who ' ll cook dinner ? Will you ?
9,6,6,Ok  I will . But let ' s go to a disco after dinner .
10,5,6,To a disco ? Oh  no . You know I hate pop .

4,0,6,No I haven ' t . I haven ' t visited the Bund either . I ' Ve always had too much work to do .

4,6,6,About ten years so far . I started learning when I was in middle school .
5,0,6,That's really interesting .
6,0,6,Sure . So what about you ? Do you have any hobbies ?
7,0,6,Well  I like collecting matchbox ! I'm not sure if that counts  though .

4,0,6,It's a cute little teddy bear !
5,0,6,How sweet ! Maybe he was just a shy guy who had a crush on you !

3,6,6,I overheard this information when I passed Arden's office . We got some complaints from consumers yesterday . I am terribly sorry for that .
4,3,6,My God ! I actually checked them one by one . How could this be ?
5,6,6,Calm down ! It is useless to act like that . Can we find some solutions ?
6,1,6,What kind of solution can I have now ? I nearly go crazy now .
7,6,6,But we still have to find one . Can we find Arden to check whether this is true or not ?
8,1,6,It seems that I have nothing to do  except this .
9,6,6,Face the reality . Maybe we can find the way to make up the loss .

4,1,6,I'm very sorry for that  but I sent you several messages to explain  my mom was seriously ill  and I had to look afer her .
5,5,6,But I ended up with finding out lady that night  that you were with other girl at cafe near your home .
6,1,6,That girl was my cousin .
7,5,6,You've got so many cousins . I called you later that night . But you didn't have the guts to answer the phone .

4,0,6,Do you prefer brandy or ports .
5,0,6,Port  please .
6,0,6,Excellent choice . I love its smooth flavor .
7,0,6,The port is quite exquisite . It must have spent years aging in barrels . Am I right ?
8,0,6,Yes . You always have a good nose for wines .
9,0,6,Next time we are about to dinner we should try some Canadian ice wine .
10,3,6,Oh  what's that ?
11,0,6,It's made from naturally frozen grapes .

3,6,6,What happened ?
4,1,6,I really wish I hadn ' t done it .
5,6,6,What on earth are you talking about ?
6,1,6,I got caught cheating . I feel so ashamed . The teacher saw me and told me I failed .
7,6,6,What were you thinking ?
8,1,6,You know my father . If I fail  he'll kill me . I have to do well .
9,6,6,But what you should do is study hard .
10,1,6,I know ... I know ... it's all my fault . I feel awful that I didn ' t study  and I cheated  and I got caught .

1,6,6,So  Emily  how was your day ?
2,5,6,I don't think you really want to hear about it .
3,6,6,It can't have been that bad . Go on and tell me about it .
4,5,6,To be honest  it was horrible ! My manager is such a pain in the neck !
5,6,6,Why ? What happened ?
6,5,6,Well  he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them  my manager blamed them on me !
7,6,6,That's not very fair . What did you do ?
8,5,6,There wasn't really anything that I could do . There's always been a lot of bad blood between my manager and myself . If I had said anything  he would have fired for me for sure .
9,6,6,Does he treat everyone in your department like this ?
10,5,6,He treats everyone pretty poorly  but the way he treats me really takes the cake !
11,6,6,Do you have any idea why he treats you worse than the others ?
12,5,6,I really have no idea . All I know is that the thought of him really curls my hair !
13,6,6,Is there anyone else you can talk to about it at you company ?
14,6,6,Not really . I'm hoping to live with it for a while until I get a promotion .
15,6,6,That's very sensible . It sounds like you have a good head on you shoulders .
16,6,6,I try to be sensible about it  but it's not very easy . Sometimes you just have to grin and bear it .
17,6,6,That's so true . When you have a taste for success  you can't let dishonest people like your manager get in the way .

6,6,6,I've fallen in love with my boss .
7,3,6,Really ? Is he married ?
8,6,6,Bo  of course not . He is still single .
9,6,6,Then what's your problem ?
10,1,6,I try to keep it to myself . But there is a lot of gossip about us .
11,6,6,Oh  I see . Office romance tends to be the subject of gossip .
12,1,6,Worse still  he is trying to avoid me these days .
13,6,6,Office romance is very tricky .
14,1,6,It gives me a lot of pressure and I feel depressed .

2,0,6,It's nice . But what kind of dress are you looking for ?
3,6,6,Something attractive and dressy . Maybe a little sexy too . New Year's Eve is a special occasion and it only happens once a year  right ?
4,6,6,Of course . It's common too that we wear something special for our Chinese New Year .
5,6,6,People here always wear the best clothes they have . Many people go out and buy clothes especially for New Year's Eve .
6,6,6,Any other common customs of your New Year ?
7,6,6,Before the New Year  we always send greeting cards to our relatives and friends to wish them a happy year . On the street and in stores people usually greet others with a ' Happy New Year ' . It's also common for people to make a New Year's resolution .
8,6,6,What's that ?
9,6,6,It's when people quit a bad habit or do something they find hard to do . Many people resolve to quit smoking  lose weight  or stop nagging their wife  etc . However  it usually lasts only for a few days !
10,6,6,By the way  where are you going on New Year's Eve ?
11,0,6,We're going to a night club for dinner and dancing  then we'll go down to the city square for the big celebration . There's always a fireworks display put on by the local government . We all want you to come too .

5,0,6,And stay in the shallow area . I don ' t want to see you go any farther than that sandbar ! It ' s too deep out there and we didn ' t bring your floatier .
6,6,6,You ' re back already ? The water was too cold  huh ? I ' ll tell you a secret . Do you see that small pool of water over there ? It ' ll be warmer in there . Go see if you can find some seashells or catch some minnows .
7,6,6,What is that ? A jellyfish ? Jeremy  put that down right now ! It could sting you !

6,3,6,Well  I am really surprised . By the way  have you done anything behind my back ?
7,0,6,No . The only thing I've ever done behind your back is zipping you up .

2,2,6,I'm getting sick of work man . I can't take the political bull in the company any more .
3,6,6,Did you just get your review or something ?
4,1,6,Yeah  but that's not why I am upset . I just found out another guy got a promotion . He doesn't know how to do anything . He sits there and kisses the managers butt all day long .
5,6,6,That sucks .
6,5,6,I'm just pissed that management can't see behind his smooth talking lies .
7,6,6,Look on the bright side . At least you have a job .
8,0,6,Yeah . I shouldn't stress about this anymore . It's not like I can do anything about it .

3,0,6,this is supposed to be your vacation ; we'd like you to just relax .
4,0,6,cooking makes me feel relaxed . So  what are we cooking ?
5,6,6,ok  well  we're going to make a pan of lasagne  a salad  and some garlic bread . Here's the recipe . Do you want to get the ingredients we need out of the cupboard ?
6,6,6,sure . We should probably pre-heat the oven right away  too .
7,6,6,that's a good idea . Can you set the oven to 200 degrees Celsius ?
8,6,6,that's a bit high for lasagne . I'll just set it at 180 degree and we can take it from there .
9,6,6,fine . I'll just get out the casserole dish  the saucepan  the salad bowl  and the baking sheet .
10,6,6,you know  I could do this myself . Why don't you go get the screwdriver and the pliers and go fix the vacuum cleaner so it works better ?
11,6,6,I don't think it's broken .
12,6,6,well  if it's not broken  then you need to learn how to vacuum better  because it doesn't look like you've vacuumed for ages !
13,0,6,fine . I'll go vacuum . Let me know if you need any other help .

7,0,6,Oh yeah  I saw the tea house the other day . I think I might go and have a look sometime . It's a nice neighborhood here .

9,0,6,There's a gym nearby ? That's exciting ! I really want to start to go to gym as soon as possible . I've been lazy this summer holiday and have put on some weight .

6,0,6,That's good for me  but do you think you'll be back by then ? I'd really like to see you .
7,6,6,Yeah  I'm expecting to come back on Tuesday .
8,0,6,Great ! That's settled then .

1,6,6,How are you doing  Andrew ?
2,6,6,Not well . I ' Ve been feeling pretty lonely lately .
3,6,6,But you have so many friends ! How could you be lonely ?
4,6,6,You know what they say'a friend to all is a friend to none ' . I don ' t feel like I really know any of my friends . In fact  I should probably call them acquaintances  not friends .
5,6,6,What about me ? I ' m your friend .
6,6,6,I know you are  you are my girlfriend . I wish I had a guy friend to hang out with sometimes .
7,6,6,I know what you mean . I find it difficult to make new friends  too . It ' s not as easy as it was when we were young  is it ?
8,6,6,Not at all .
9,0,6,I ' Ve made a lot of new friends since I started learning English . Maybe you could join a club or take a class to make some new friends .
10,0,6,That ' s a good idea .
11,6,6,What kind of qualities do you look for in a friend ?
12,6,6,I ' m not sure . I guess I ' d like to meet some people who have a positive attitude and want to have a good time .
13,0,6,People who play ultimate Frisbee have a positive attitude ; maybe you should join the ultimate Frisbee club .
14,0,6,That ' s a possibility . Thanks !

1,0,6,This is how a holiday should be . Relaxing on the beach with a nice cool drink .
2,0,6,Isn ' t it wonderful here ? The kids are enjoying themselves in the swimming pool . I hope it ' s safe .
3,0,6,Don ' t worry about them . They ' re very responsible . Besides  there are many people there and there ' s lifeguard employed by the hotel . Waiter ! Could I have another drink pleas ? Thank you . So  what shall we do this evening ?
4,0,6,The kids said that they wanted to go to a party at the hotel . There ' s a special one just for kids .
5,0,6,So  we could try that restaurant that was recommended in the guidebook . Then we could go to a club . We haven ' t been to one for ages .
6,0,6,That ' s a great idea . We can really enjoy ourselves without worrying about the kids .
7,0,6,Now  how about going for a swim in the sea ? We shouldn ' t sunbathe all day .

2,6,6,I'm just watching some television .
3,6,6,I'm so bored . I don't know what I'm going to do today and it is only ten in the morning .
4,6,6,Me too . Do you think we are boring people ?
5,6,6,I don't think we are boring . It's just that we don't have any hobbies .
6,6,6,That's right . What do you think we should do as a hobby ?
7,6,6,That all depends on what you like to do . For example  I like to doodle on the notepad  so I'm thinking about doing some real drawings .
8,0,6,I like to play the piano for fun .
9,0,6,Yeah . That can be a good hobby .
10,0,6,Hobbies are great . I'm going to make a list of all the things I like to do .

5,0,6,Honey  how about taking them to the beach this weekend ?
6,0,6,That's great !
7,0,6,Since last time we've climbed the mountain  we haven't gone out for a long time .
8,0,6,And this kind of weather is rare for the season either .
9,0,6,Yes  I remember last year this time  the weather is so hot .

3,3,6,Dad ! Are you serious ? What ' s the point of having central heating if we can ' t use it ! Look  I can see my breath !
4,5,6,Put on a sweater ! I ' m not gonna let you run up my heating bill just because it ' s a bit chilly .
5,5,6,Dad ! I ' m gonna catch a cold !
6,5,6,When I was your age  my parents didn ' t have central heating like you do ! We had a furnace in the center of the living room and that was it . We used it to cook  heat the house and even dry our clothes ! We never caught a cold . You should be grateful !

1,6,6,I think that show biz stars have a really easy life . They have lots of money  so they can buy almost anything they want . They ' re famous  so everyone loves them .
2,6,6,I think they must have horrible lives . All the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . They must get sick of it .
3,6,6,I bet they love it really . Sure  they complain about it  but that just gets them more publicity  doesn ' t it ?
4,6,6,I think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . They only want it for their films .
5,5,6,No way ! They want publicity for themselves  so that they get invited to make more films  go to lots of cocktail parties  and even make albums ! They have such an easy life . They don ' t even pay for Drin
6,6,6,Show biz stars have plenty of expenses . That ' s why they need so much money . They need million of dollars to buy big  seclude houses and wonderful dresses . I bet most show biz stars would prefer to Wea
7,5,6,I don ' t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . They ' re overpaid  over-ambitious  and over-adored .
8,6,6,I think you should give them some credit . They ' re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . They even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves
9,5,6,Come on ! They only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves .

7,6,6,How did you meet her ?
8,6,6,We are in the same math class . Our teacher sat us next to each other .
9,6,6,What do you like best about her ?

3,6,6,I will come clean as soon as we get to safety  OK ? For now  you have to trust me  please ! I would never do anything to hurt you .
4,4,6,Steven  I ...
5,6,6,I haven ' t been completely honest with you Veronica  I ' m sorry . I ' m not a fireman . I ' m not even from the United States . I ' m a spy for the Indian government .
6,3,6,What ? Why didn ' t you tell me before ? What are you doing here ?
7,6,6,When I was a young boy  I used to play cricket my father back in my hometown of Hyderabad . It was a peaceful town  and my father was a renowned chemist . One day  he was approached by members of the CIA  claiming that my father had made the discovery of the millennium in his small lab back at the university where he taught bio-chemistry . I never saw him again . I vowed to discover the whereabouts of my father and consequently joined the Indian Intelligence Bureau .
8,5,6,What does that have to do with those men shooting at us ? Most importantly  why did you lie to me !
9,6,6,I ' m sorry  I wasn ' t supposed to meet you . I wasn ' t supposed to fall in love with you  but you have to believe me when I tell you that what I feel for you is real .
10,5,6,I can ' t believe this ! Why are all these things happening to me ! I can ' t take it anymore ! Let me out of the car !
11,6,6,Veronica  wait !

1,6,6,Hi  Larry  how was your weekend ?
2,6,6,Not bad . We had a get-together with friends from college . I haven't seen many of them since graduation . How about you ?
3,0,6,Great . I hung out with Jo all day shopping  and the went out for dinner together .
4,0,6,Sounds a good weekend . You know it always amazes me that two people as different as you and Jo can become such close friends .
5,0,6,Yeah  I never thought we could be good friends either . We have our differences . She's more outgoing and active while I am more quiet and reversed  but we still get along extremely well . We can talk for hours about anything .
6,0,6,That's great . I know people who can't stand each other for even five minutes .
7,0,6,When Jo and I are together  we argue a lot  but that's also part of the fun . Besides  I know she will always be there for me when I need her  and she knows I'll be there for her .
8,0,6,It seems you two bring out the best of one another .
9,0,6,Exactly . Having Jo as my friend is one of the best things that's ever happened to me .
10,0,6,Yeah  you are so lucky to have found each other .

3,0,6,Yes ! We have all assumed that you were the quiet  shy type .
4,6,6,I guess everyone has a few secrets up their sleeve .
5,6,6,Where did you learn to sing like that ?
6,6,6,I was part of a band in school .

6,6,6,What were you screaming at me for ?
8 12
 (12, 11),
1,6,6,Hi  Becky  what's up ?
2,6,6,Not much  except that my mother-in-law is driving me up the wall .
3,6,6,What's the problem ?
4,6,6,She loves to nit-pick and criticizes everything that I do . I can never do anything right when she's around .
5,6,6,For example ?
6,6,6,Well  last week I invited her over to dinner . My husband and I had no problem with the food  but if you listened to her  then it would seem like I fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . There's just nothing can please her .
7,6,6,No  I can't see that happening . I know you're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen .
8,6,6,It's not just that . She also criticizes how we raise the kids .
9,6,6,My mother-in-law used to do the same thing to us . If it wasn't disciplining them enough  then we were disciplining them too much . She also complained about the food we fed them  the schools we sent them too  and everything else under the sun .
10,6,6,You said she used to ? How did you stop her ?
11,6,6,We basically sat her down and told her how we felt about her constant criticizing  and how we welcomed her advice but hoped she'd let us do our things . She understood  and now everything is a lot more peaceful .
12,0,6,That sounds like a good idea . I'll have to try that .

6,0,6,It's fantastic .
7,6,6,Why did you go there ?
8,6,6,I went there on business .
9,6,6,And do you have friends there ?

2,6,6,Hi honey ! What ' s wrong ? Why do you have that look on your face ?
3,5,6,What ' s wrong ? I thought we agreed that you were gonna quit smoking .
4,6,6,No ! I said I was going to cut down which is very different . You can ' t just expect me to go cold turkey overnight !
5,5,6,Look  there are other ways to quit . You can try the nicotine patch  or nicotine chewing gum . We spend a fortune on cigarettes every month and now laws are cracking down and not allowing smoking in any public place . It ' s not like you can just light up like before .
6,6,6,I know  I know . I am trying but  I don ' t have the willpower to just quit . I can ' t fight with the urge to reach for my pack of smokes in the morning with coffee or after lunch ! Please understand ?
7,5,6,Fine ! I want a divorce !

4,0,6,How fun ! Can I bring something ?
5,6,6,Don't worry about it ! Just come at five .

4,6,6,Okay . Um ... can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top .
5,0,6,Don ' t you worry  I ' ll take care of everything ! Oh my god ! I just love your curly hair ! It ' s so fluffy and cute ! You should totally let it grow out . An afro would look great on you !

3,0,6,Avril Lavigen !
4,3,6,The Canadian rock singer ? But I heard you had a part-time job yesterday . How did you see her ?
5,6,6,Yeah  I worked as temporary staff in her concert . Look  her poster  a CD ...
6,6,6,So you're a big fan  eh ?
7,6,6,Not really . But I like some of her songs . She's actually very talented . She's a song writer and fashion designer  too .
8,6,6,And she was in a movie once again  right ?
9,6,6,Yeah  though I don't think her acting skills are that great .
10,6,6,What was your impression of her when you saw her in person ?
11,6,6,She looked sweeter than her pictures .
12,6,6,Did you take a photo with her ?
13,6,6,No  there were too many people . When she got out of the car  her fans were all screaming  trying to give her flowers and to get her autographs .
14,3,6,Crazy !

 (1, 1),(2, 1),(3, 3),(5, 1),(5, 3),(10, 10),
1,5,6,Oh  my God ! I've been cheated !
2,3,6,What ? What did you buy ?
3,5,6,It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it !
4,6,6,What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ?
5,5,6,There was a guy on the sidewalk . He had three new boxes  Panasonic video camera boxes . He said he had to get rid of them quick .
6,6,6,And ?
7,6,6,So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks .
8,6,6,And it's a brick ?
9,6,6,Yes .
10,3,6,I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ?
11,6,6,I wanted to . But he said  no  the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store . If it's opened  other people won't believe it's new .
12,6,6,So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic .
13,6,6,Yes  it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products . Look  it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new .
14,6,6,But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ?
15,6,6,He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen .
16,6,6,Aha ! Now I understand . You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk . So  what I think is  you deserve to get cheated !
17,6,6,C'mon  don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it . We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box .
18,6,6,That's no problem . He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy . And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from . Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there . Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around . So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you . Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks .
19,6,6,You're right  Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ?

3,5,6,Yes  and hurry up !
4,1,6,I'd like to apologize for my carelessness . May I clean it up for you ?
5,6,6,No  I'll do it myself .
6,6,6,Here is my card  sir . Could you send me the cleaning bill and I will refund the cost to you ?
7,6,6,I should think so  too !
8,1,6,I'm very sorry to have caused you this trouble .
9,5,6,Yes  and please be more careful in the future !

2,0,6,Thank you  Rick . We ' Ve got a very exciting encounter ahead of us today as two powerhouse teams  Brazil and China  face off against each other and try to qualify for the next round . Without a doubt  both teams are in top shape and this will prove to be a competitive match .
3,0,6,The ref signals the start of the game and here we go . Ribero serves and China quickly receives the ball . Chen bumps it to the setter  and ... a very nice set by Chen !
4,0,6,Xu spikes it ! Wow  what a great hit ! The Brazilian blockers anticipated the play and tried to block him but he managed to get the ball in ! Great play .
5,0,6,It ' s China ' s service now . What a superb jump serve by Li  oh  and we have a let serve . The ball was coming in fast and almost made it over the net .

4,6,6,You did what ? Helen  I know it's gross  but I ' Ve seen many public washrooms that are much worse . Why are you cleaning the counter top ? are you out of your mind ?

8,3,6,No kidding ! Jack is such a log ! He's never dated a girl .
9,6,6,The problem with Joe is that she's too shy to tell him .
10,6,6,And the problem with Jack is that he seems to have no interest in girls . He's putting his heart into his stamp collection .

5,0,6,I really miss the change of seasons like we have in Colorado ; but I must admit  this sure is a nice spring day .
6,0,6,Hey  this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
7,3,6,Okay . Hey  is that a dark cloud over there ? Do you think it will rain after all ?
8,6,6,I don't think so . I say the weather report last night  and it said the weather should be fine all day .

6,6,6,Why ? I think the meeting went well .
7,3,6,Really ?
8,6,6,Yes . But what are you worried about ?
9,6,6,I'm afraid I was too rude .
10,6,6,Rude ? You weren't rude at all  Annie . Why do you think you were rude ?
11,6,6,Well  I maybe talked to Mr . Drummond too directly . I thought I maybe said too much . I don't want him to be angry .
12,6,6,I understand . But really you weren't rude at all . You said what you thought . I think he appreciates that .
13,3,6,Really ?
14,6,6,Yes .
15,6,6,But I am new here  and I'm not sure he is used to that .
16,6,6,You mean because you are a woman ?
17,6,6,Yes . And he is the president of the company .
18,6,6,Listen  Annie . You shouldn't worry about Mr . Drummond . He is a very good man to work for . He is not sexist at all . He appreciates people for their ideas . And he is willing to take suggestions from men or women .
19,0,6,I am very happy to hear that  Karen . It ' s good to know I'm working in such a company .
20,6,6,I agree with you on that  Annie . I've worked for Derek Drummond for nine years now . I feel he appreciates his employees for their work  not their gender . I would never change jobs .

3,5,6,He does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy .
4,6,6,I suggest you talk with him and teach him how to deal with the problems .
5,5,6,I have told him how to do it several times  but he's never listened to me .
6,6,6,Maybe you should communicate with him like a friend and not a boss .
7,6,6,Oh  I always have difficulty in getting along with the staff .
8,6,6,Just take them for your good friends and have a talk with them as we do  make sure you don't lose your temper .
9,6,6,I think that's a bad idea . I'd hate anyone here to think of me as a friend . How would they ever respect me as they can do whatever they want ?

5,6,6,Oh  yeah ? What's it about ?
6,0,6,Well  it's the classic love story between two people from conflicting backgrounds . But besides a beautiful story  the cinematography is great . There is some really dramatic footage . It's really quite a visual feast . And the soundtrack is moving .
7,0,6,Sounds pretty good . Is it a tragedy ?
8,6,6,The ending is a bit of a surprise . I don't want to ruin it for you .
9,6,6,Oh  I like movies with surprise endings  although  sometimes they can be frustrating . Maybe I should invite my girlfriend to go next weekend .

1,6,6,Excuse me . Is there any body here ?
2,6,6,Yes .
3,6,6,I've finished up all my water . I would kill for a sip of water .
4,6,6,Sure  come on in .
5,0,6,Thank you very much . Are you here alone ?
6,6,6,My father and sister are out to photographing . What about you ?
7,6,6,I'm a back-packer from America .
8,6,6,What is a back-packer ?
9,6,6,It means a hiker who loves traveling around the world .
10,0,6,Cool . You must have been to a lot of places .
11,0,6,Yes  actually almost half of all the countries over the world . I love traveling places .
12,0,6,So cool . I want to be a back-packer when I grow up .
13,6,6,You can do it . But do work hard on your English to make it easier .
14,6,6,I'll try my best .

1,6,6,So  Monica  what do you feel like doing this afternoon ?
2,2,6,Actually  I had a perfect plan for this afternoon  but it is totally ruined by the sand storm . I woke up this morning and found it was sunny . So I called Lucy and asked her to go shopping with me . We were going to look for a new purse . Now it turned out to be like this . Neither of us wants to go to outside anymore .
3,2,6,That ' s too bad . I hate sand storms too . It can be worse than any kind of bad weather .
4,2,6,What ' s wrong with climate ? Anyway  I think the sand storm happens more frequently these days than the years before . Can ' t people do something to stop it ?
5,6,6,It is not an easy job . The government is working on it . Lots of trees have been planted in the north of the capital . Also  methods of generating rain are being used by the government to fight against the drought . But of course  it will not work overnight . So  have you come out with a new plan for today ?
6,6,6,My new plan is to wait for the end of the sand storm and clean my apartment .

1,6,6,Hey John  nice skates . Are they new ?

3,6,6,What position do you play ?
4,6,6,I ' m a defender . It ' s a lot of fun . You don ' t have to be able to skate as fast on defense .
5,6,6,Yeah  you ' re a pretty big guy . I play goalie  myself .
6,3,6,Oh  yeah ? Which team ?
7,6,6,The Rockets .

1,6,6,Do you think the weather will be good this weekend ?
2,6,6,I heard it might rain .
3,6,6,Oh . That ' s a pity . I thought that we might go hiking in the hills .
4,0,6,Mmm ... Well we could go to that new art gallery instead .
5,0,6,Yes that might be a better idea .
6,0,6,Maybe we ' ll meet some of the artists too .
7,0,6,Ok - let ' s do that then !

 (2, 1),(3, 2),(4, 1),(4, 1),(5, 4),(6, 5),

1,6,6,Tomorrow is Halloween  I know I'm ready . I bought two pumpkins and a big bags of candy . Do you want to help me a jack-o-lantern ?
2,0,6,I'd love to . I heard about Halloween when I was in Beijing . It's kind of a children's day . Small kids get dressed up  then walk around with paper bags or baskets  knocking on the neighbor's
3,6,6,They are supposed to say trick or treat ? Then the neighbors are supposed to hand up the candy .
4,0,6,That's kind of cool . But what's the trick mean ?
5,6,6,Usually it's the older kids going around playing Halloween  like punching the pumpkins left outside people's doors or - - someone's tree . They usually do it late at night after little kids go
6,0,6,That sounds kind of fun  maybe I can get tighter with my friends that night .
7,6,6,Usually be adults  you don't have kids have a big party in get dressed up too .
8,0,6,That does sound a lot of fun .

 (3, 3),(4, 3),(4, 4),(5, 3),(5, 4),(6, 6),
1,6,6,I usually bowl with an eight ball . I like the control of a light ball . I can spin it more  so that the ball hooks .
2,6,6,Well . I like them a little heavier . I don't have as much control  usually bowling straight  but the extra momentum compensates for that .
3,0,6,Well  let's see which technique is better . I think I'll go up first ... Yes ! I hit a strike . I knocked them all down on my first bowl .
4,0,6,Well done . You got them all . You get 10 points and your next two bowls are added to this frame's score . I'II dry my ball off and try to knock them all down as well .
5,0,6,Good start . You knocked eight pins down . But you are left with a 710 split . Unless you can bowl a UFO-ball on this bowl  it is going to be impossible .
6,0,6,I certainly can try ... No ! It went straight through the wickets .

7,6,6,Clean it now . Only lazy people say they'll work tomorrow .

3,5,6,Great  because I am really mad at William . I mean  what kind of an idiot wouldn't be able to appreciate a smart  beautiful woman like me ? Anybody who would be friends with that guy has to be really dumb .
4,6,6,Uh  A ... you know I'm friends with William .
5,5,6,Oh right ... present company excluded  of course !

1,3,6,I can ' t believe my English teacher is making me read pride and prejudice !
2,3,6,Why not ! It ' s a classic ; in fact  it ' s one of my favorite novels .
3,6,6,But it ' s so old .
4,6,6,Don ' t judge a book by its cover . Do you Kwon what it ' s about ?
5,6,6,No  not at all .
6,6,6,First of all  it ' s a romance novel  set in the early 19th century .
7,6,6,I didn ' t realize it was a romance novel . What ' s the main storyline ?
8,6,6,It ' s basically about a father who tried to marry off one of his five girls .
9,6,6,Why does he want to do that ?
10,6,6,Since he doesn ' t have a son  he hopes that one of the girls will marry a wealthy man . That way  all of his daughters will be cared for .
11,6,6,Won ' t they get his inheritance ?
12,6,6,No  that ' s the problem . Though they are well-off  once he dies  his house will go to his cousin . So  when he dies  the girls will have nothing .
13,0,6,I see . This sounds interesting ! Maybe my teacher isn ' t so horrible after all .
14,6,6,So  are you going to read the novel or watch the movie ?
15,3,6,There ' s movie ? My teacher didn ' t tell me that !
16,6,6,That ' s probably because she wants you to read the book first .
17,6,6,It would take a lot less time ..
18,6,6,How about this . When you finish the book . I ' ll get the movie and watch it with you .
19,0,6,Ok . That sounds like a deal .

 (2, 2),(3, 3),(5, 5),(7, 7),
1,6,6,What ' s wrong with you ? Why are you scratching so much ?
2,1,6,I feel itchy ! I can ' t stand it anymore ! I think I may be coming down with something . I feel lightheaded and weak .
3,4,6,Let me have a look . Whoa ! Get away from me !
4,6,6,What ' s wrong ?
5,4,6,I think you have chicken pox ! You are contagious ! Get away ! Don ' t breathe on me !
6,6,6,Maybe it ' s just a rash or an allergy ! We can ' t be sure until I see a doctor .
7,4,6,Well in the meantime you are a biohazard ! I didn ' t get it when I was a kid and I ' Ve heard that you can even die if you get it as an adult !
8,6,6,Are you serious ? You always blow things out of proportion . In any case  I think I ' ll go take an oatmeal bath .

1,6,6,It's time to leave the office for the night . Firstly I log off my computer  then I set the electronic security system .
2,0,6,That's pretty advanced .
3,6,6,Now I'll quickly send a short message to my wife and take the elevator down to the basement .
4,6,6,Is that where you park ?
5,6,6,Yes  the car park is under constant video surveillance  so my car is quite safe . Please get in .
6,0,6,Thank you . Where is your key ?
7,6,6,There's no need  I have keyless entry  and the steering wheel recognizes my finger prints before starting the car . Now  we can look at the navigation system to find the best route home .
8,3,6,That's amazing  it even shows all the roads that are congested at the moment .
9,6,6,Using GPS I can rely on this to direct me home . Now I just need to find my E-Card to automatically open the gate and we can drive out .
10,0,6,Pretty soon cars will be driving themselves .
11,6,6,Maybe  but in the meantime why not help me find the remote control for my garage door ?
12,0,6,Here it is  and here we are .
13,6,6,When I turn off my home alarm  the house will automatically tum on the lights and set the climate to a comfortable level .
14,0,6,I have to get home  but I don't need all of this fancy technology  I think I'll just walk .

7,3,6,Really ? It looks so nice .
8,0,6,Thank you  Please have a cup of tea .
9,0,6,All right .
10,0,6,How about some fish ?

3,0,6,How nice seeing the sun back again ! The air is so fresh .
4,0,6,I hope it stays nice like this for a long period of time .
5,6,6,Well  the weather is so unpredictable this time of year .
6,6,6,You're right . We don't know what is going to be like tomorrow .
7,6,6,Look ! It looks as if it is going to rain .
8,6,6,The weatherman predicts a fine day today .
9,6,6,The weather is often quite different from the weather forecast .
3906 6
 (2, 1),(4, 4),(6, 5),(6, 6),
1,6,6,Did you set your clock forward for daylight savings time ?
2,3,6,What ? Why do we have to do that ?
3,6,6,Well  at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon . This is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth . In any case  to take better advantage of the daylight available  we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour .
4,5,6,I see . That ' s convenient ! I never understood things like this  such as GMT . I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock !
5,6,6,That just stands for Greenwich Mean Time . Here in California  we are in Pacific Standard Time  that is eight time zones west of Greenwich . Remember when we were in Beijing ? Well  then we were in China Standard Time  and that ' s eight time zones east of Greenwich !
6,3,6,That ' s why it was so weird traveling from Beijing to LA ! Because of the huge time difference  even though we left Beijing at noon and flew for more than eight hours  we still arrived in LA the same day at noon ! It ' s like we went back in time !

4,1,6,You know how hard I try to quit  I've lost without you . I am mot let you go .
5,5,6,It's not just for your drinking . But you are lacking sense of responsibility .
6,1,6,I have to make money to support the family  so I have little time left to share with you .

2,6,6,part-timer ? Is that a new buzzword ?
3,6,6,oh  it ' s pretty popular among my classmates these days . So are you ?
4,6,6,sure  I have a part-time job as a bartender .
5,0,6,cool ! It must be amazing to work at a bar !
6,6,6,yeah  but I ' m not there for fun . I have to remain professional and if I get distracted  the manager would be pretty upset .
7,6,6,that ' s true . I ' m wondering did you learn anything from the job ?
8,6,6,of course . There ' s always much to learn . I got to know more about the real world .
9,6,6,you mean you got working experience  right ?
10,6,6,not just working experience . I would say the biggest lesson I learned is how to deal with people from all walks of life .
11,6,6,it must be very demanding .
12,6,6,sometimes it is . But after working for a few weeks  it ' s easy to figure out .
13,0,6,really ? It sounds interesting .
14,6,6,maybe you can come to the bar one day and I ' ll show you around .

3,0,6,Let's do both ! Are we in a rush or anything
4,6,6,No  not really . I had thought we'd stay in Hamburg tonight  but we can't unless we rush it . Let's stay in Bremen instead . Tomorrow we can have lunch in Hamburg  then check into a hostel in Copenhagen and have dinner there .
5,0,6,Sounds fine to me . Whatever  let's enjoy this pond first .
6,0,6,Sure . We can walk around to that path that leads into the woods there . Hey  look ! There are some wild ducks over there in the reeds .
7,0,6,I see them ! Wow ! How do you know they're wild ?
8,0,6,I used to go hunting with my uncle  that's how .
9,0,6,They're neat . Now Let's take that path into the woods and see what we can see ...

7,6,6,Not really . I plan to bring some cash and withdraw money at the ATM in Japan .
8,6,6,Do you have the bank card in Japan ?
9,6,6,Nope . You can use the credit card to withdraw the money in foreign countries .
10,0,6,That sounds really convenient . Do you pay extra money to enjoy this service ?
11,6,6,No . It is free of charge .
12,0,6,Great ! I will apply for a credit card when I go to the bank later .
13,6,6,I think we are running out of time . The bank is going to close soon .

3,6,6,To me English is a difficult language .
4,6,6,A second language is always difficult .
5,6,6,True  but English is harder than most . It's a crazy language .
6,3,6,A crazy language ? Why do you say that ?
7,6,6,One letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings .

2,0,6,Yes ! Yes ! And yes ! Jared  of course I ' ll marry you !
3,0,6,Oh  Babe  I can ' t wait to spend the rest of my life with you ! I can ' t wait for all the adventures we ' re going to have  for all the fights and the laughter . I can ' t wait to grow old and wrinkly with you .
4,0,6,Oh  Jared ! I can ' t wait for our wedding ! I hope you don ' t mind  but I ' Ve already chosen a date ! Six months from now in the summer ! Melissa saw you buying the ring last month so I ' Ve had plenty of time to start planning !
5,6,6,She what ?
6,6,6,Oh don ' t worry  sweetie  I didn ' t know when you were going to propose . It was still a nice surprise ! As I was saying  I ' Ve got it all planned out . There ' s almost nothing left to do ! I wrote up our guest list and we will have roughly four hundred guests attending .
7,6,6,Four hundred ?
8,6,6,No need to sweat it . My parents agreed to pay for most of the wedding  which is going to be low-budget anyway . So roughly four hundred people  which means that the hall at Northwoods Heights will be our reception venue . I thought it would be nice if we had the wedding at your parents ' church and my uncle of course would be officiating . We ' ll meet with him soon for some pre-wedding counseling . The music for the wedding ceremony was a no-brainer . My step-sister and her string quartet will take care of that . My cousin will be the official photographer . I thought it would also be nice if his daughter could sing a solo . Did you know that she ' s going to be a professional opera singer ?
9,6,6,Ah ...
10,6,6,And then of course the ladies at the church would love to be our caterers for the banquet and we ' ll get the Youth Group to serve us . I was thinking that your friend ' s band could be our entertainment for the night . though they might have to tone it down a bit . Or we could hire a DJ . Your sister ' s husband could get us a discount with that company that does the decor at weddings . what ' s their name again ? I was thinking that we could have an island paradise-themed wedding and our theme color would be a soothing blue like Aquamarine . And there will be a huge seashell on the wall behind the podium where we ' ll make our toasts ! What do you think of small packages of drink mixes for our wedding favors ? Who else am I missing ? Oh  your uncle could be our florist and his wife could make our wedding cake !
11,6,6,Wow .
12,6,6,See ? It ' s going to be wonderful ! Oh this wedding is going to be everything I ever dreamed of .
13,6,6,If I survive the next six months .

3,6,6,I guess it ' s formal .
4,6,6,Then  you should dress well .
5,6,6,That ' s right .
6,0,6,I think a white shirt with a blue tie looks nice on you .
7,0,6,You are smart .
8,6,6,Of course  the sports shoes don ' t go with the formal occasions .
9,6,6,You are right . What kind of shoes should I wear ?
10,0,6,The brown leather shoes go well with your trousers .
11,0,6,Good idea . Oh  by the way  would you please pick me up after the party  honey ?
12,6,6,It ' ll be too late ; you ' d better take a taxi .

2,0,6,Yeah ! I bought it the day it was released .
3,6,6,How do you like it ?
4,6,6,It's a great game . There are a lot of new characters .
5,6,6,Did it cost very much
6,6,6,It cost about thirty . Most games cost about that much .
7,0,6,Mechwarrior is such a good game . The graphics are awesome !
8,0,6,Oh  I know what you mean . I'm addicted to that game .
9,6,6,My roommate always wants to play it . But I told her to buy her own game .
10,6,6,Yeah  my roommate likes to watch me play . He says it's like watching a movie .
11,0,6,I've never seen such good graphics .

1,6,6,Have you followed the value of dollar lately ?
2,5,6,How could I help but follow it ? The fluctuation of dollar is killing my company ! The exchange rates are eating into our profits  and we can't do anything about it .
3,5,6,It's really frustrating  isn't it ? I have the same problem . I would feel a lot better if the currency was a little more stable . With the way the dollar plummeting lately  my securities have gone up in smoke .
4,5,6,Every day I have less money ! I haven't spent anything  it is just melting away because of the shifts in exchange rate .
5,6,6,What we really should be making investment in is the Euro . I've followed the Euro's progress over the last quarter  I think it's about time to buy in .
6,6,6,What about the Yen ?
7,3,6,Are you kidding ? The Yen is in worse shape than the Dollar !

5,3,6,Look ! He has a partner !
6,3,6,He's dancing with Jack !
7,2,6,Gross !
8,6,6,The wei-ya is the one time a year you can make fun of the boss .
9,2,6,But I think Eddy is going too far !
10,6,6,You're right . They are spinning pretty fast . Aren't they getting dizzy ? What if they fall ...
11,6,6,Oh ! Ouch ! That must've hurt !

3,6,6,Where's Hyde Park ?
4,6,6,It's on the other side of the Palace .
5,6,6,That's the place where people make speeches on Sundays  isn't it ?
6,6,6,Yes  you're right . Politicians of all kinds  religious people  and one or two madmen .
7,0,6,Well  are we going there today ? I want to take shots there .

3,6,6,Come on . We ' Ve been through this already ! Look  I know the adjustment was hard when you first got here  but we agreed that you were gonna try and deal with it .
4,1,6,I was . It ' s just that the holidays are coming up and I won ' t be able to home because I can ' t afford the airfare . I ' m just longing for some of the comforts of home  like my mom ' s cooking and being around my family .
5,6,6,Yeah  it can get pretty lonely over the holidays . When I first got here  I ' d get depressed and nostalgic for anything that reminded me of home . I almost let it get to me  but then I started going out  keeping myself busy and before I knew it  I was used to to it .
6,1,6,I see what you mean  but I ' m still bummed out .
7,6,6,OK . how does this sound . let ' s get you suited up and hit the dance club tonight . I hear that an awesome DJ is playing and there will be a lot of pretty single girls there !
8,0,6,You know  I could really go for that . You don ' t mind being my wingman for tonight ?
9,6,6,Not at all ! It be fun ! It will be like a boys ' night out ... well kinda ...
10,6,6,Great ! I must warn you though  whatever happens  don ' t let me go on a drinking binge . Trust me  it ' s not a pretty picture !

2,0,6,Let's plan a surprise party for him !
3,0,6,Can you spread the word and ask everyone to bring some kind of snack food ?
4,0,6,That's easy . Anything else ?
5,6,6,Will you call his wife and let her know so that if she is available  she can come too ?
6,0,6,Won't he be surprised !
7,6,6,I don't know how old he is though .
8,6,6,That's O . K . Maybe his wife will spill the beans !

2,6,6,Yes  what a wonderful day ! The sky has cleared up in the end .
3,6,6,I do feel like an outdoor exercise . After all  we haven't had such a beautiful day for a long time .
4,0,6,How about taking a walk in the park ?
5,0,6,OK . It's delightful to have a walk in the park with the air so fresh .
6,6,6,( After they entering the park ) Great  it's so quiet here . We have the park to ourselves  only you and me .
7,3,6,Are you kidding ? Don't you see many people over there ? Just on your right .

1,6,6,Hey Jack . What's going on ?
2,6,6,Hey Matt . I'm going to ask Martha to marry me ?
3,3,6,Really ? When did you decide this ?
4,6,6,I always knew she was the one  but I decided to pop the big question about 2 weeks ago . I'm just debating on how to do it .
5,0,6,That's exciting  man .
6,6,6,So how did you propose ?
7,6,6,You shouldn't use my example . It wasn't special . I kind of wish I made it more special but it's too late now .
8,6,6,What do you think I should do ?
9,6,6,There are a lot of options . You can surprise her over dinner  or ask her in a public area  or if you have the balls  ask her father in front of her .
10,6,6,I never thought about that .
11,6,6,Thought about what ?
12,6,6,Asking her father in front of her . How do you think she will react ?
13,6,6,I don't know . You should know how she's going to react . She is your girlfriend .
14,0,6,I think that's the idea I was looking for . Thanks  man .
15,0,6,Don't mention it . Good luck . You're going to need it .

2,0,6,Great ! I would like to see cute pandas  too .
3,0,6,How can we get there ?
4,0,6,We can take the MET and get off at the Zoo Station .
5,0,6,OK ! Let's go .
6,0,6,( At the zoo ) Wow ! This zoo is really huge .
7,6,6,Yes  you can find hundreds of various animals here . It is the biggest zoo in Taiwan .
8,6,6,Look at the map . It has different areas  such as marine lives  mammals  polar animals and insects .
9,6,6,Where can find the pandas ? I think we are here to see the pandas .
10,6,6,We have to go to the mammal area . We are at the gate right now . We need to go straight from here and turn left and go along to the end and make anotherleft turn .
11,6,6,It should take at least 20 minutes to get there . Are there any shuttle buses running place to place around the whole zoo ?

1,0,6,Hi Amanda  how are you ? I've missed working with you and the whole gang since my transfer last week .
2,0,6,We've missed you too . The office just isn't the same without you . How is your new job ?
3,0,6,It's great . I really get to focus on what I like to do and everyone has been very nice and welcoming . However  I'm having a small problem with my new colleagues .
4,6,6,What happened ?
5,6,6,Well  three people are celebrating their birthdays this month and the policy here is for everyone to contribute ten dollars to a card and cake for each person .
6,0,6,Wow  so you'll be out thirty dollars on your first week at work !
7,6,6,I know . It is a lot of money and I haven't gotten to know any of the people celebrating their birthdays well enough yet . At our old department  it was only three dollars for each birthday and there were only ten of us .
8,6,6,Well  every department is different . You wouldn't want your new co-workers to think you're a Grinch  right ?
9,6,6,What is that ?
10,6,6,A Grinch is a person who spoils the mood at a happy occasion by being selfish or unenthusiastic . You know - a party proper .
11,6,6,I definitely don't want to be that ! But  I still think it's unreasonable for them to ask me for such a big sum of money when we don't know each other very well . What should I do ?

1,6,6,Martha . What's wrong ? Why are you crying ?
2,1,6,Jake just broke up with me .
3,6,6,I'm sorry . When did this happen ?
4,1,6,Yesterday . I didn't even know it was coming . He just told me he found someone else .
5,6,6,What a jerk . He doesn't deserve you .
6,1,6,But it still hurts . I thought I loved him .
7,6,6,He didn't treat you that well either . Maybe you don't want to hear this  but I think you can do better .
8,1,6,Better or worse  it doesn't matter . I had a lot of feelings for him . I really liked him
9,6,6,It must be really painful . I remember when Josh and I broke up . I was crying for a week .
10,1,6,I know . I'll get over him . My first break up was painful because I was naive .
11,6,6,Exactly . You'll find someone again . You should get your mind off of this . Let's go shopping .
12,6,6,Maybe tomorrow . I don't feel like it tonight .
13,6,6,How about coffee down the street ?
14,6,6,Sure .

1,0,6,Did you see Ally Mabel last night ?
2,0,6,Yes  I did . Did you ?
3,0,6,Yes  wasn't it funny ?
4,0,6,Oh yes  I loved it . Wasn't the scene with the judge great ?
5,0,6,Ha  yes  brilliant !

1,6,6,Well  I am a regular member of this club .
2,6,6,Do you have to pay to join ?
3,6,6,Yes  membership fees vary depending on the club but usually they run into tens of thousands of dollars .
4,3,6,Wow  that much ? Don't they have any public courses ?
5,6,6,Very few  unfortunately .
6,6,6,How was your game today ?
7,0,6,Extremely good . I shot a 78  including 5 birdies !
8,0,6,Congratulations ! What's your normal handicap ?
9,6,6,Ten . How did your game go ?
10,1,6,My drives were terrible today . I kept slicing the ball into the roughs and sand traps .
11,6,6,Maybe you can correct it by going to a driving range before you play again .

2,0,6,I'd enjoy that .
3,0,6,I'll pick you up around 8: 00 .
4,0,6,OK . I'll see you then .

2,0,6,Yes  of course . This is really a nice party with wonderful people and lovely wines .
3,0,6,I ' m glad you ' re enjoying it .
4,0,6,Thank you for the invitation .
5,0,6,It ' s my pleasure . Would you like another glass of champagne ?
6,0,6,Yes  please . Thank you for everything .

1,6,6,Hey  what's up ?
2,6,6,Oh  nothing .
3,6,6,What were you writing ?
4,0,6,( Laugh ) All right . You caught me in the act . I finally worked up the nerve to ask Diana out . I was just writing a note to put on her desk .
5,6,6,You mean you're going to ask her out in a note ? You big chicken !
6,0,6,I admit it . I'm a wuss . I just can't do it in person .
7,6,6,But  you work with her everyday .
8,0,6,That's different . When I'm working  I'm in a different frame of mind . But  when I even think about asking her out  I get tongue-tied . At least in a note  I can get the words out without turning beet red .
9,6,6,You've dated a lot . What's so different about Diana ?
10,0,6,Well  for one thing  she's gorgeous . She's so upbeat and sweet . Who doesn't like her ? Oh  I don't know . All I do know is that I think we have great chemistry together . But  what if I'm wrong . Maybe she's just been nice to me out of courtesy and doesn't think of me that way . Oh ... forget it . This was a bad idea .
11,6,6,Well  I guess you don't want this note  then .
12,6,6,What note ?
13,6,6,I was looking for you to deliver this note from Diana . She wants to know if you want to go to the office party with her tomorrow night .
14,3,6,You're kidding ! I can't believe you've been standing this entire time and didn't say anything .
15,0,6,Sorry . What can I say ? Now  do you want the note or what ?
16,0,6,Yeah  I want the note .
17,0,6,Have a great time tomorrow night .
18,0,6,Thanks . I plan on it .

1,5,6,Oh  the food here really is bad . My soup was cold and meat  ur ... it was like leather .
2,5,6,Yes . And they don ' t give you very much either . I ' m still hungry .
3,5,6,I ' m sure this one is especially bad . And the word is so unpleasant .
4,5,6,Don ' t do this ! Don ' t do that ! You mustn ' t do this ! You can ' t do that !
5,5,6,Well  I ' m going to write a letter of complaint .
6,5,6,And we ' ll all help you .

1,0,6,How do you like this waltz ?
2,0,6,It's very nice . I like it very much .
3,0,6,Well  then  may I invite you for the first dance ?
4,0,6,My pleasure . But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer  and I suppose you dance often .
5,3,6,Me ? Oh  no . In fact  I only took up dancing quite recently .
6,3,6,Oh  really ? But you're doing the waltz wonderfully well .
7,0,6,I'm glad you say so . You dance beautifully too . It's lucky that I got you as a partner .
8,0,6,Thank you for your compliments . It's just you are a good leader . Do you like the foxtrot and tango ?
9,0,6,Yes . And what dances do you like best ?
10,0,6,Disco is my favorite . I like it better than any other dances because it can release one's hidden feelings  and is a healthy exercise . But I don't do the rock and roll nor break-dancing .
11,0,6,Oh  well  the music has stopped . Thank you for the dance .
12,0,6,My pleasure .

2,0,6,Yes . After so many years of hard work  I ' d rather I had an office of my own .
3,0,6,If you need help  don ' t hesitate to ask me .
4,0,6,I ' ll be very glad if you would help .
5,0,6,I ' d like to wish you every success in your new venture .
6,0,6,Thank you . I wish I would .
7,0,6,Good luck to you .

 (2, 2),(3, 2),
1,0,6,That was heaven !
2,0,6,The sea water treatments are supposed to be really good for you .
3,3,6,Really ?
4,6,6,But the water has to be kept at 34 degrees so that the minerals can be absorbed by your body .
5,0,6,Well  whatever it does  I feel transformed !

1,0,6,It's weekend again  I'm glad I can arrange for my personal matters .
2,6,6,What do you mean by that ?
3,0,6,Oh  that means I can do whatever I like without few interruptions .
4,6,6,You've been always active and versatile . It seems that you are interested in everything .
5,6,6,Oh  really ? I just have lots of hobbies in my spare time ; such as going to the concert  painting  handwriting  reading novels and reading fashion magazines . What about yours ?
6,6,6,I have fewer hobbies than yours . That's why I find campus life a bit dull and uninteresting .
7,0,6,Oh  you can't think like that . We young people should try our best to learn new things and accept new ideas . You like taking photos and going to photography shows  why not practise the technique and catch something unforgeable ?
8,0,6,That's a good suggestion . It's fine today . Maybe I can take photos on the scenery of the lake at sunset . It must be fantastic .
9,0,6,I quite agree with you . With our hobbies  our life can be more colorful and exciting .
10,0,6,And I can concentrate on my study after the relaxation over the weekend .
11,0,6,Yes  it's a good habit to have a life-long hobby . Those who practise calligraphy and Qigong always live longer .

1,0,6,Did you watch the finale last night ? My favorite singer won !
2,0,6,Oh  I love him too . He not only sings well but shows perseverance when he encounters difficulties in the contest .
3,6,6,Yeah  he got booted after his initial performance in the audition  but he did not give up . He then tried at another two auditions .
4,6,6,He had barely survived the third audition and finally got a chance to advance in the contest . Fortunately  in the third audition  he has won popularity among the audience . And that's when I started to notice him .
5,6,6,Me too .
6,6,6,Before he made the top three  I was so nervous . I just fear that he might be knocked out .
7,6,6,Yeah  there're so many excellent candidates out there . Who knows which one will make it to the final ?
8,0,6,Absolutely . That's why when he entered the finale  I was so excited .
9,6,6,He really did a great job in the finale  especially in the PK round . He performed so well that the majority of the audience cast their votes for him .
10,0,6,And the host announced that he won it all !

1,6,6,Oh dear  Miss  you are soaked ! Wow  it's really raining heavily outside .
2,6,6,Yes  it sure is . I had to run here from work ! I need to rush as I'm on my lunch break .
3,6,6,Well please  why don't you go ahead of me in line ? I'm in no hurry .
4,0,6,Oh  that's so nice of you ! Thank you very much .
5,0,6,My pleasure Miss . Actually  could you recommend what to eat here ? I've never been here before .
6,6,6,Sure . Well  the avocado sandwich is delicious  and it's the healthiest thing on the menu . Personally  I think the beef salad is the tastiest choice . I usually get that . Also  the milkshakes are the best milkshakes in town !
7,0,6,Well  thanks for the suggestions .
8,0,6,Oh  don't mention it .

1,0,6,Guess what came in the mail today ?
2,6,6,What ?
3,0,6,My acceptance letter to Yale !
4,0,6,Wow ! Congratulation ! When do classes start ?
5,0,6,Freshman orientation is the last week of august  but I want to go two weeks before that to get settled in .
6,0,6,You ' re so lucky ! Do you have to do many things before you leave ?
7,6,6,Yes . I ' ll be very busy ! I have to get a visa  buy a plane ticket  and pack my things . But first  I want to register for classes .
8,6,6,When can you do that ?
9,6,6,Well  they sent me their prospectus  so I can start looking now . do you want to help me decide which classed to take ?
10,6,6,Sure . What can you choose from ?
11,6,6,Well  I have to take all the fundamental course  plus a few from my major .
12,6,6,What is your major ?
13,6,6,I hope to major in English literature  but the admissions counselor told me that many people change their major many times in their first year  so we ' ll see .
14,6,6,What are the fundamental course ?
15,6,6,In order to graduate  every student must take a certain amount of classes in history  math  English  philosophy  science and art .
16,6,6,Interesting . That ' s very different from the Chinese education system .
17,6,6,Yes  it is . It ' s also very different from the British education system .
18,3,6,Really ?
19,6,6,oh  sure . In British  students don ' t have to take the foundation course .
20,6,6,why not ?
21,0,6,maybe because they think they know everything already ! ha ha .

1,5,6,I ' Ve had it ! I ' m done working for a company that is taking me nowhere !
2,6,6,So what are you gonna do ? Just quit ?
3,5,6,That ' s exactly what I am going to do ! I ' Ve decided to create my own company ! I ' m going to write up a business plan  get some investors and start working for myself !
4,6,6,Have you ever written up a business plan before ?
5,5,6,Well  no . it can ' t be that hard ! I mean  all you have to do is explain your business  how you are going to do things and that ' s it  right ?
6,6,6,You couldn ' t be more wrong ! A well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . Then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has  history  etc .
7,6,6,Well  that seems easy enough .
8,6,6,Wait  there ' s more ! Then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . What they are and how they are different from competitors ' ? Then comes the hard part  a market analysis . You need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables ! You need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from GDP per capita to how many children on average the population has ! All this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage  where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea .
9,6,6,Geez . Is that all ?
10,6,6,Almost  the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . Here you will calculate and estimate sales  cash flow and profits . After all  people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !
11,0,6,Umm . I think I ' ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !

1,6,6,I've enjoyed conversing with you .
2,5,6,Is there a reason why you're trying to get off the phone so fast ?
3,6,6,I've got to go .
4,5,6,I wasn't done talking to you .
5,5,6,I have to do some things  and besides  it's not polite to be nosey .
6,6,6,I'm not being nosey . I'm just asking .
7,5,6,I really don't think it's any of your business .
8,5,6,That's not nice .

1,6,6,Who's that tall guy over there ?
2,6,6,Oh  that's George . He looks very drunk .
3,6,6,What's he like normally ?
4,6,6,Oh  he's really reserved  normally . But  from what I hear  he's got lots of problems .
5,3,6,Really ? What kind of problems ?
6,6,6,Well  off the record  of course  but I hear that he's got terrible debts . He has his own company  and it's not going very well .
7,6,6,Really ? Well  I hate to say this  but I'm not surprised .
8,3,6,Really ? What makes you say that ?
9,6,6,Well  he doesn't look very honest .
10,6,6,I know  that's the problem . He can't find any customers . It's a pity  really  because his products are very good . Oh  that reminds me . Did I tell you about my new laptop ?
11,6,6,Oh  don't talk to me about laptops . Mine crashed on Friday and I lost everything . I hate them .
12,6,6,Oh  really ?
13,0,6,Look  I need another drink . Do you want one ?
14,0,6,Yes  I'll have another cocktail .
15,0,6,Vodka martini ?
16,0,6,Absolutely .

2,0,6,It's interesting  I like being an editor .
3,6,6,Why ?
4,0,6,I like talking to writers  I get to meet a lot of interesting people .
5,0,6,I'm happy to hear that  but publishing is more than just talking to writers . it involves a lot of work  patience and responsibility . Most of the work is boring .
6,0,6,I don't feel bored at all . I'm getting along with my colleagues . I will enjoy working with them . People are great in this industry .
7,6,6,Do you have any complaints ?
8,6,6,No  I have no complaints . I hear there are many opportunities to move up in this company . is that true ?
9,0,6,Yes  you have many opportunities to grow in this company as long as you do well .
10,0,6,That's perfect . I will definitely do well .

1,0,6,Hey  That's a really nice outfit you have on .
2,0,6,Why  thank you . I wasn't sure if it looked okay or not . I can't believe all the words the salesgirl said .
3,0,6,Oh  you look stunning . Your dress really goes well with your shoes .
4,0,6,I'm glad that you think so . I thought it might be a bit too revealing .
5,0,6,No  not at all . It looks really classy on you . Where did you pick that up ?
6,6,6,I got it on sale down at the department store .
7,6,6,When did you go there ?
8,6,6,I was just there a couple of days ago . You know  you should go down there too . They have a lot of stylish clothes on sale .
9,6,6,I might just do that . What style of clothes do they have ?
10,6,6,Anything you want . They have both casual and formal styles .
11,6,6,I was hoping to get a few new ties for my collection .
12,6,6,That's a good idea . Some of your ties are pretty outdated .
13,6,6,Well  I spent a lot of money on getting my shirts tailor-made  so I couldn't afford to buy any new ties .
14,6,6,Anyways  are you going to the party tonight ?
15,6,6,Yes  I am . Say  are you going to wear that outfit to the party ?
16,6,6,I don't think so . It is a little too formal . I'm probably going to wear something more laid back .
17,6,6,Me too . I will probably go dressed in a T-shirt and jeans .
18,6,6,I guess that you will really be dressing down .
19,6,6,That's my style when I'm not in the office .
20,0,6,Good point . I suppose that we all have our own individual styles .

1,0,6,I have never seen so many flavors of ice cream in one place !
2,0,6,There certainly are a lot . Can you choose a favorite ?
3,0,6,Vanilla with toppings is my favorite .
4,6,6,Is there anything as good as a hot fudge sundae ?
5,6,6,No way ! Do you have a flavors you don't like ?
6,6,6,I don't like ice cream with too many different flavors in it .
7,6,6,I agree with that  it just doesn't work for me .
8,6,6,I saw garlic ice cream on the menu once .
9,2,6,I think that would be horrible !
10,0,6,I think I'll stick with a more traditional choice today !

2,1,6,There will be a parents ' meeting in our class this Saturday and I am worried about it .
3,6,6,Why ? We can leave school earlier that day .
4,1,6,I didn't do well in last exams . If my father knows it  he will beat me up .
5,3,6,I can't believe it . My parents never beat me .
6,1,6,You know that my father is irritable .
7,6,6,You can ask the teacher for help .
8,6,6,Good idea .

2,0,6,Yes . I like it very much .
3,6,6,Cooking is a hobby with me . I'm always trying to think up new recipes . I hope you like the soup . It's kind of a specialty of mine  so I hope you enjoy it .
4,0,6,It's excellent .
5,6,6,Thank you for your compliment . Won't you try this fish with white sauce ? I'm rather round of it .
6,0,6,It's delicious .
7,6,6,What sort of western food do you like best ?
8,6,6,I like beefsteak very much . Have you tried Chinese dishes ?
9,0,6,I find the Chinese dishes wonderful .
10,6,6,Well  it's getting late . I have to get up early tomorrow . So I must say good night .

2,0,6,Sure  thanks . I brought you a bottle of wine as well .
3,6,6,You're the first guest to arrive . I'll just put your coat away and then I'll get you something to drink .
4,6,6,Should I take my shoes off ?
5,6,6,Whatever you prefer .
6,0,6,This is a very nice place . How long have you been living here now ?
7,6,6,Just over three weeks . Would you like a drink ?
8,6,6,Sure  what do you have ?
9,6,6,I've got white wine  red wine  gin and tonics  ginger ale  lemonade  orange juice  and sprite .
10,6,6,I'll have a glass of red wine please .
11,0,6,One glass of red wine coming up !
12,6,6,So how many people are coming for the dinner tonight ?
13,6,6,There's just going to be 6 of us tonight .
14,3,6,Oh  I thought there were going to be eight . who isn't coming ?
15,6,6,Marcia and Paul called to cancel at the last moment . Paul was running late and Marcia wasn't feeling well .
16,1,6,That's too bad . They ' re such good company .

1,3,6,Can you believe her ? She is not even a hundred pounds and she is going off on how she wants to go on a diet .
2,6,6,Tell me about it . If I was as small as her  I wouldn't think about going on a diet .
3,6,6,Me too . But what are we going to do ? I have been on 4 different diets and I can't seem to lose weight .
4,6,6,That's because you don't exercise . If you were more active  you wouldn't have a dieting problem .
5,6,6,What do you know ? You are over weight too .
6,6,6,I'm not on a diet though .
7,6,6,I know . But I don't have someone to diet with . If we help each other and motivate each other  then I think we can lose some weight .
8,6,6,I like ice cream too much though .
9,6,6,C'mon . You'll feel better and look better and as a reward you can eat a little bit of ice cream here and there .
10,6,6,It does sound appealing .
11,0,6,It's a great idea . I can't believe I didn't think of this earlier . Going on a diet with a friend to back you up is a great way to succeed .
12,0,6,Okay . I'm in . Let's do it .
13,0,6,Great . I'll get our plan started right away .
14,6,6,Can we start tomorrow though ?

5,5,6,Sorry isn ' t good enough ! What can you do to help me ?
6,6,6,I understand why you ' re angry  Mrs . Wilson  and believe me  we are doing everything in our power to work this out .
7,5,6,Well  obviously  what you ' re doing is not good enough !

5,6,6,So  since when is your house a bank ?
6,6,6,What do you mean ?
7,6,6,I mean  what ' s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows .
8,4,6,Security  Dan  security ! You can never be too safe you know ! A lot of sickos out there . Just the other day they caught that peeping tom red handed ! Had a high power telescope and binoculars by his window .
9,6,6,What ' s the matter with you ? Why are you acting all paranoid ?
10,4,6,Paranoid ? I ' m not paranoid ! I ' m cautious ! You see Dan  we have to be on guard at all time ! People just invade your privacy as if they knew you ! Telemarketers  solicitors  even your bank ! They have way too much information ! I like to keep everything on a need to know basis .
11,6,6,OK  well  what did you want to see me about ?
12,4,6,You are being watched ! Be careful Dan ! Be careful !

3,6,6,Anything interesting on ?
4,6,6,Not really . Just watching the sports highlight on ESPN .
5,6,6,So I take it you're pretty bored too .
6,6,6,Just killing time until I find something to do . What are you going to do ?
7,6,6,It's Saturday and we are sitting at home doing nothing . What's wrong with us ?
8,6,6,You wanna shoot some hoops ?
9,6,6,I already tried to call up some of the guys  but they are all busy .
10,6,6,Where's your girlfriend ? I thought you were going out with her today .
11,6,6,She's out shopping with her friends .
12,0,6,Let's go to Starbucks and think of something to do then .
13,0,6,Aright . Do you have any cigarettes ?
14,6,6,I only have a couple left . Why don't you pick some up on the way .
15,0,6,Ok . See you there in about 30 minutes .

5,6,6,How about Thursday ?
6,6,6,Yes  Thursday would be fine . What time shall I come ?

4,0,6,Well  I ' Ve been working so hard lately  so I ' ll probably just take it easy .
5,0,6,Sounds nice .

1,6,6,We've got a new manager in our department .
2,6,6,Oh ? You hoped to get that job  didn't you ?
3,6,6,Yes  I did .
4,6,6,I'm sorry . That's too bad . Who is it ? Who got the job  I mean ?
5,6,6,Someone called Drexler . Carl Drexler . He's been with the company onlytwo years . I've been here longer . And I know more about the job  too
6,6,6,Hmm . Why do you think they gave it to him and not to you ?
7,5,6,Because I'm the wrong sex  of course !
8,6,6,You mean you didn't get the job because you're a woman ?
9,5,6,Yes  that was probably it ! It isn't fair .
10,6,6,What sort of clothes does he wear ?
11,6,6,A dark suit . White shirt . A tie . Why ?
12,6,6,Perhaps that had something to do with it .
13,6,6,You mean you think I didn't get the job because I come to work in jeansand a sweater ?
14,6,6,It's possible  isn't it ?
15,6,6,Do you really think I should wear different clothes ?
16,6,6,Well . . . perhaps you should think about it .
17,5,6,Why should I wear a skirt ? Or a dress ?
18,6,6,I'm not saying you should . I'm saying you should think about it . That's all !
19,5,6,Why should I do that ? I'm good at my job ! That's the only important thing !
20,6,6,Hmm . Perhaps it should be the only important thing . But it isn't . Not in this company .

1,0,6,Welcome back ! How was your vacation ?
2,0,6,It was fantastic  but I'm glad to be back ! Being a tourist is really tiring !
3,0,6,Where did you end up going ?
4,0,6,Because it's off-season  we got a really good package deal to Paris  so we went there .
5,0,6,I've always wanted to go to Paris . The Eiffel Tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! Did you go to the top ?
6,0,6,That was the first thing we did . I have a few pictures . Do you want to see them ?
7,6,6,Sure . What's this one a picture of ?
8,6,6,Oh  that's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . I'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city .
9,6,6,You don't look very happy in that picture .
10,6,6,No  by that time  I was sick of sightseeing . I had had enough of art galleries  cathedrals  fountains  statues  and palaces !
11,6,6,So what did you do ?
12,0,6,We spent that afternoon walking around a flea market . We had a few coffees  watched a movie  and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel .
13,0,6,My travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . Did you go to the Louvre ?
14,0,6,Of course ! You can't go to Paris without going to their famous art gallery ! I was surprised by how small the Mona Lisa was though .
15,0,6,That's what everyone says ! I can't wait to see it for myself some day .

 (1, 1),(2, 1),(3, 3),(4, 3),(5, 5),
1,0,6,Your search on this project has been excellent .
2,0,6,Thank you . I couldn ' t have done it without the help of a strong team .
3,0,6,The final report is exceptionally thorough and well done . I think that you have been come up with some interesting recommendations for the client .
4,0,6,Well  I hope the client feels the same way !
5,0,6,I am sure they will be pleased .

1,6,6,I want to say ...
2,6,6,Say it ! What is it ?
3,1,6,That I can't go on any longer without you .
4,3,6,You know you shouldn't say that at a time like this .
5,6,6,Nancy  I made up my mind you were the only woman for me at the first sight .
6,3,6,Too sudden ! I'm not ready for it .
7,1,6,Forgive me for startling you with the impetuosity of my sentiments .
8,6,6,Stop it . No more of that talk .
9,0,6,I really love you .
10,3,6,No  I shall faint .
11,0,6,And I hope so . This is what you were meant for . Say you love me  say yes  say yes .

1,6,6,I don ' t know what I ' m going to do ! It ' s going to be impossible to make ends meet if I lose my job !
2,6,6,Don ' t worry . I don't think you ' re going to lose your job over one mistake .
3,6,6,It was a rather big mistake . When you work as an investment adviser  one small mistake can cost the company millions .
4,6,6,But it wasn ' t just you who was involved  right ? You were only doing what your supervisor told you to do .
5,6,6,That ' s true  but my supervisor is very dishonest . There ' s no reason he needs to tell our boss the truth . I ' m sure he will tell our boss that it was all my fault  and there ' s nothing I can do about that . My boss won ' t believe me if I tell him the truth .
6,6,6,Let ' s think realistically about what might happen . How much money do you have in your savings ?
7,6,6,I have enough to live off of for about 3 months . But I really don't want to spend my life savings on just living ! I ' d rather invest my money somehow .
8,6,6,Well  you can't have everything . Let's just figure out what you will do if you lose your job . When is your contract up on your apartment ?
9,6,6,Next month . So I can either move out then or renew my contract for another year .
10,0,6,Well  that ' s good . If you lose your job  you can just move in with me until you find another job . That will save you plenty of money .
11,0,6,That ' s very generous of you . I guess that would work .
12,0,6,If you lose your job  you just have to go for a few months without buying all the junk you usually buy . If you live frugally  you ' ll save plenty of money .
13,0,6,I guess working with so much money has made me rather greedy . Maybe losing my job would be a good thing !

3,5,6,Sure . You look like you're all black and blue .
4,6,6,I am fine . In fact  I don't have a scratch on me or my vehicle . But the other guy is in critical condition .
5,3,6,You're serious ?
6,1,6,Yes  I'm serious . I'm really sorry about missing your concert .
7,6,6,I guess I misjudged you . I hope you can forgive me .
8,6,6,Of course I forgive you . What are friends for ? Now  what am I going to do for that other guy ?

3,2,6,Oh  don't talk to me about yesterday ! It was the most awful evening I've ever had .
4,3,6,Why ! what happened ?
5,2,6,Well . John had promised to be my date  but he stood me up . I waited for a full hour in the cold wind .
6,6,6,So how long did you stay ?
7,2,6,I left after the opening dance . I couldn't wait to get out of there .

2,1,6,I'm sorry . I forget all about it .
3,5,6,How could you ? I reminded you just this morning .
4,1,6,It's leap my mind . I really feel terrible about it .
5,1,6,I have been looking forward to this performance all month .
6,1,6,I'm really sorry I let you down . I'll make it up to you somehow .

2,6,6,Yes  please . What's special today ? Any special recommendations ?
3,6,6,Certainly . I would recommend ' Songshuguiyu ' .
4,6,6,The name sounds fascinating . What is it exactly ?
5,6,6,Well  it is sweet and sour fried Mandarin fish .
6,6,6,Sorry  I'm not interested in vinegar .
7,6,6,Then  how about this one ?
8,6,6,OK . I'll have that .
9,0,6,Very good . Could I serve you anything else ?
10,0,6,Thank you . That's enough .
11,0,6,My pleasure . Just a little while  your order will be ready very soon . Please enjoy your lunch .

1,6,6,Did you see the information on sales for last year ? The sales review was made at our last board meeting . There's a great news for our shareholders .
2,0,6,Yeah  I went over the figures this morning . We're finally started making money again !
3,0,6,We've never sold this much before  our growth this year has been phenomenal . We have captured 8 % of the market  up from last year by 120 % . Our strategy is working !
4,0,6,not only our annual sales brake a record  but our month by month earnings exceeded our forecast as well . After a two-year slump  we finally back in the black .
5,6,6,The company's performance has improved since Wallace became president . He's made our little business into a real lucrative operation . Products are selling like hotcakes .
6,6,6,I think our success is partly because of Wallace's contribution  and partly because of our new marketing strategy . Because of the new advertising campaign  we have become the top sellers in the field .
7,0,6,Let's hope this stroke of good luck lasts . I hope we are over our financial difficulties for good .
8,0,6,Let's hope it is !

7,6,6,What are you so ticked off about ?
8,6,6,I don't want to talk about it .
9,6,6,Maybe I can help .
10,6,6,I blew the finally exam .

3,6,6,Where are you going ?
4,6,6,We're going to visit my sister in the city .
5,6,6,I didn't know your sister lives in the city  when did she move there ?
6,6,6,About a year ago . She lives in an apartment on 3rd street  across from the public library .
7,6,6,I see . It's almost 5:00 PM now  don't you think there will be a lot of traffic ?
8,6,6,Oh  we're not driving . We're going to take the subway . The subway only takes about 20 minutes .
9,6,6,Yes  but it can be very crowded around this time . I always feel uncomfortable taking the subway .
10,6,6,I take the subway to work everyday  so I'm used to it now .
11,6,6,Doesn't your mother live in the city ?
12,6,6,Yes  she's lived there for about ten years .
13,6,6,I remember when she moved there . Apartments were a lot cheaper then .
14,6,6,I know what you mean . It's hard to find anything that's reasonable now .
15,6,6,Have a good time . Next time you're free  give me a call and we'll go play poker .

4,6,6,Grannie always tries to stay fit and healthy . She is always making us kids eat the proper foods .

3,6,6,What movies have you seen lately ?
4,6,6,I saw Forrest Gump the other day .
5,6,6,What type of movie is that ?
6,6,6,The movie type is drama .
7,6,6,I can't believe you are watching movies . The weather is great . You should be outside .
8,6,6,I hate the hot weather . I'd rather stay indoors with the air conditioner .
9,6,6,What else do you like to do besides watching movies ?
10,6,6,I like to play computer games  read books  go shopping  and play pool .
11,6,6,Out of those what is your favorite ?
12,6,6,My favorite is to play computer games .
13,6,6,What is your favorite computer game ?

4,0,6,I guess that is the thing we can do with we really want to visit the museum .

7,0,6,Good idea .
8,0,6,( After the breakfast ) Which floor is the art exhibition we are going to ?
9,0,6,I have no idea . Let me take a closer look at my museum map
10,0,6,Sure  take your time . We have a whole day .
11,0,6,It's on the 2nd floor . We are going to see some beautiful paintings about the history of ancient Greece .
12,0,6,Look at the museum guide . It says there are also some sculptures and potteries in this area . Let's rent an audio guide .

2,1,6,What fools we were !
3,6,6,To think of it ! All my old silver ! It meant so much to me .
4,6,6,And my new car . To think that he simply drove off with everything in my car . That's what hurts me most .
5,1,6,What's so terrible too  is the fools we've made of ourselves .
6,6,6,I hardly dare call the police . They'll just laugh at us .
7,5,6,I'll never get over it . Oh  Harry  it was all so unnecessary . That man ! ! How could he do this to us after we'd put him up ?

7,0,6,But what do you say about that ?
8,6,6,I don't really enjoy big occasions  but I think I ' ll come round to the idea in the end  It only happens once in a lifetime .
9,6,6,Perhaps I'll agree with Mike . I couldn't stand a big wedding with many relatives and friends of my parents or my wife whom I'd never met before .

2,0,6,what do you mean ?
3,0,6,I mean look at all these magnificent tall buildings around us .
4,0,6,yes  look over there . That's the Empire State Building . My book says it's 102 stories tall .
5,0,6,it's quite famous but don't you think it looks a bit old-fashioned ?
6,0,6,you're right  but when it was built in 1930 it was a marvel of technology and engineering .
7,0,6,what other important buildings are we going to see on Fifth Avenue ?
8,0,6,quite a number . Actually every skyscraper has a history . A few blocks ahead we'll see St . Patrick ' s Cathedral and just across the street will be the world-renowed Rockefeller Center . It's a landmark
9,0,6,what's there after that ?
10,0,6,well then  there's a Central Park . Facing the park on Fifth Avenue is probably some of the most expensive properties in the world .
11,0,6,what are all they for ?
12,0,6,most of them are office buildings  huge department stores  and hotels but some are just private homes . New York is one of the financial centers of the words so there are lots of very expensive places .

4,6,6,In my country football is brand new  so I never learned the game when I was younger .
5,6,6,It's a very popular game in America .
6,6,6,Yeah . I heard a lot about it . Is it really that fun ?
7,6,6,For me  it's one of those games that are fun to both watch and play .
8,6,6,Are you a football player ?
9,6,6,No  I just for fun with my friends . We play two hand touch or flag football . We're too old to play tackle football .
10,6,6,What is two hand touch and flag football ?
11,6,6,Instead of tackling somebody  you just have to touch them with two hands  or if it is flag football  grab the flag that the ball carrier is wearing .
12,6,6,I see . It's safer then right ?
13,0,6,Exactly . We play every Saturdays on the field by the tennis courts . If you want to learn and play a little  you're welcome to join us .
14,0,6,I'll give it a try . Give me a call and let's go down together .
15,0,6,Ok . I'll call you Saturday morning .

4,6,6,Yes  it was a very evenly matched game .
5,6,6,What were the results of the game ?
6,6,6,It ended in a tie .
7,6,6,What was the actual score ?
8,6,6,It was three all .
9,3,6,Really ? I thought Barcelona was going to win . They are a much better team than Madrid .
10,6,6,If Barcelona had played as they normally do  they should have won .
11,6,6,What happened ?
12,6,6,Their goalkeepers got injured after the first goal  but he kept on playing anyway .

2,6,6,I knew this would happen some day .

4,6,6,Well . It's not all my fault  Anna . You are responsible  too .
5,5,6,I don't want to argue anymore . Please get out of my life !
6,6,6,I think we can still talk .

1,2,6,I am totally fed up with my boss . He has crossed the line one too many times with his sexist comments . This time I am really going to report him for sexual harassment .
2,6,6,What happened ? Did your boss say something to offend you at work ?
3,2,6,He constantly lets inappropriate things slip out  referring to the women employees as girls or calling us sweetheart or darling . I doubt any of my male colleagues would stand for such treatment .
4,6,6,Don ' t you think you are overreacting a little ? Calling you by nicknames shouldn ' t be so bad ...
5,2,6,You ' re missing the point . It ' s about respect . He treats us with such a patronizing attitude  as if we are not equal or not as serious as our male co-workers . It ' s his attitude that needs to be changed  not just his words .
6,6,6,That ' s what you get for working in a male-dominated field . I think you ' ll find that most male bosses in your industry are already conditioned to treat females in this way . You probably won ' t be able to change him .

1,6,6,Hi  long time no see . How have you been ?
2,1,6,Oh  I've been fine  but I'm having some trouble with my son .
3,6,6,Tell me all about it .
4,1,6,Oh  he's 14 and in the past few months  he's become quieter and a bit secretive . He locks himself in his room and I think he's running around with the wrong crowd .
5,6,6,Oh  I see . What makes you think that ?
6,1,6,Well  he's become friends with a couple of older boys who are in a band . And one night last weekend  he came home really late  way past his curfew .
7,3,6,Really ? What happened ?
8,1,6,He told me that his friend's car broke down and they had to walk home .
9,6,6,I see what you mean . I understand why you're concerned . Have you tried talking to your son about it ?
10,6,6,I haven't yet . I just keep hoping it's just a phase he's going through .
11,6,6,You may be right  but it doesn't hurt to find out more about what's going on in his life .
12,0,6,You're right . I should talk to him . Sometimes  it's not easy being a parent . Thanks . It helps to get it off my chest . You're always so easy to talk to .
13,0,6,I don't know about that  but my door is always open . Stop by anytime .

5,0,6,At least more than 100 years old .
6,0,6,Let's enter it !
7,6,6,I can't open the door .
8,6,6,It must be locked .
9,6,6,Let me ask the old woman in that reception office .
10,6,6,She can't answer you .

2,2,6,I quite agree with you . They are terrible . They are complete waste of time  but my wife disagrees with me .
3,2,6,Actually  what bothers me is the violence . There are far too many detective and police shows .
4,2,6,I couldn't agree with you more . There aren't enough educational programs  and even the news shows are not well done .
5,6,6,You are absolutely right . They are too brief . They don't tell you anything .

5,6,6,Well  you can give her a set of pearl earrings  or this beautiful heart-shaped pendant . What is her favorite gemstone ?
6,6,6,That purple one . I ' m sorry ... I ' Ve never bought jewellery for anyone and I ' m kind of nervous .
7,6,6,Don ' t worry  we specialize in providing our customers a relaxed  pressure-free shopping environment . That stone is an amethyst . We have a range of beautiful amethyst pieces .

15,6,6,how late were you ?
16,6,6,only about 5 minutes .
17,6,6,you got fired for being a few minutes late ?
18,6,6,my boss is really picky about that . He never arrives late  usually works over-time  and always gets his work done on time .

5,3,6,Wow ! What a hit !
6,0,6,Yeah  he tackled him so hard his helmet came off .
7,6,6,Is he ok ?
8,6,6,It looks like it  he ' s getting up .
9,6,6,I guess he hit him too hard ; the referee just called a penalty on the home team .
10,6,6,The Giants ?

12,6,6,Well  here we go again .

4,5,6,Fine ! By the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !
5,5,6,I don ' t slurp my coffee . And plus  how can you hear it when you ' re shouting into your phone all the time ?
6,5,6,You ' Ve got to be kidding me ! You ' re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?
7,6,6,Look  we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions  and it ' s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . But  it ' s probably not a good idea to keep it up I ' m willing to forgive and forget and if you are .
8,0,6,Fine . Let's call a truce . I'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down .

1,0,6,Is this Zhang Lin's home ?
2,0,6,Yes . Oh  it's you  Linda . I haven't seen you for a long time . Well  come in and sit down . How about something to drink ?
3,0,6,Yes  please . I'm a little thirsty  actually .
4,0,6,Would you like tea or coffee ?
5,0,6,Coffee  please .
6,0,6,Here you are .
7,0,6,Would you like to talk over a drink ?
8,0,6,That sounds good . How are you doing  Linda ?
9,0,6,Just fine . Are you busy now ?
10,0,6,No . I'm just killing time .
11,0,6,Shall we visit our math teacher tomorrow ?
12,0,6,Yes . I haven't been in his house for several weeks . When shall we start ?
13,0,6,How about eight o'clock tomorrow morning ?
14,0,6,All right . See you tomorrow .

1,6,6,Mary  it was wrong of you to be so late . Mother ' s very worried .
2,6,6,I ' m so sorry I ' m late . But Henry ' s car broke down .
3,2,6,I don ' t really like Henry . I like my Rose .
4,2,6,I don ' t like your Rose . And I do love Henry . And I ' m going to marry him .
5,6,6,But my Rose is great .
6,2,6,Your Rose is a fool .
7,5,6,Really  Mary  you ' re horrible .
8,5,6,Why don ' t you marry Rose  then ?

1,0,6,Did you see the 2005 Grammy Awards on TV last night .
2,0,6,Yeah . I was so happy  because my favorite singer  Ricky Martin won ' Best Latin Pop Performance ' .
3,0,6,He seems to win awards everywhere .
4,0,6,He is really great . He has sold millions of records worldwide . He is especially known for his rocking performance at the football World Cup song-the Cup of World .
5,0,6,I heard one observer even said ' It was a song sung in Spanish for international football  and he made it so popular that even the Americans loved it . '
6,0,6,That's right . His voice ranges from the smooth sound of ballads to the highpowered rhythms of the Spanish Caribbean where he grew up . He has fan clubs across the world  from America to Russia  from England to Taiwan  from Norway to Australia .

1,0,6,This is going to surprise you  but I'm happy . I think you're making the right move .
2,6,6,You do ?
3,0,6,Look  maybe I shouldn't tell you this  but I'v going over to WebTracker  too .
4,3,6,No way ! That's great ! Then we'll still be together !
5,0,6,Actually  I'm already working for WebTracker . Vince never wanted to give me what I was worth  so I figured  what the heck .
6,3,6,No kidding ! I can't believe this . You devil !
7,0,6,It's kind of cool  isn't it ? I'm sort of like a secret agent .

1,0,6,Your garden is looking beautiful this summer . The flowers are really colorful .
2,0,6,Thank you . I have roses  tulips  and daffodils . Do you like the rockery with the smaller flowers ?
3,0,6,Yes  I do . Those are violets  aren ' t they ?
4,0,6,Yes  they are . This afternoon  I ' m going to prune the hedge .
5,0,6,The lower branches on that tree are hanging very low . Would you like me to cut them off for you ?
6,0,6,Thank you ! That would be very kind of you . I have a saw in the garden shed .
7,0,6,When the lower branches are removed  you ' ll be able to sit under the tree .
8,0,6,Tomorrow  I ' ll cut the grass . Then the garden will lock perfect .
9,0,6,Just make sure children don ' t play in the flower beds and destroy the flowers .

2,6,6,Not tonight . I promised to go to a concert with my sister .
3,6,6,Well ... How about Friday then ?
4,0,6,That sounds fine .
5,0,6,Good . Shall we say seven o'clock ?
6,0,6,I'll be there . You're still a fabulous cook  aren't you ?
7,0,6,That'll be for you to decide . I've got a new dish that I want to try out on you .
8,0,6,I'm ready . I'll look forward to it all Friday !

2,0,6,I trust you ' re keeping well ?
3,0,6,I'm doing great  thank you .
4,0,6,So we can get down to business .
5729 6
 (1, 1),(2, 2),(3, 3),(6, 5),
1,0,6,Mmm . Nice and crunchy . And they leave a space uncovered for you to hold ...
2,0,6,They're so much fun to eat . You can suck all the coating off first ...
3,0,6,Or just stuff the whole thing in your mouth at once !
4,6,6,But that way you're not savoring it .
5,6,6,Whatever . Give me another pack .
6,3,6,Hey ! The movie hasn't even started and they're almost gone !

1,0,6,What a nice dress  Jean . You look marvelous !
2,0,6,You  too . Where did you get your new hat ?
3,0,6,From the Crown's . Oh  what lovely earrings you have ! Are they diamond ?
4,0,6,Yes . It's a birthday present from my husband !
5,0,6,Well  you are lucky to have such a considerate husband . Mine hasn't brought me a single rose since we married .
6,0,6,He'll come out with surprises . Just wait and see . Look at that woman  with the white chiffon !
7,0,6,She's chic  isn't she ?
8,0,6,Yes . I like the dress . It must be the latest fashion . Look  the hem has lowered  and the waist narrowed .
9,0,6,It makes me feel rather shabby . That woman has a good taste in dressing  I would say .
10,0,6,Yes . She dressed with an individual flair . I rather envy her .
11,2,6,Most women follow fashion like sheep . They don't know any better than imitate .
12,2,6,I quite agree with you . See the woman there ? I dare say she hasn't got any eyes . How could she match the mauve gown with the green handbag ? And all that jewelry !
13,0,6,The gown is quite expensive  believe me .
14,2,6,So what ? It only makes her look cheap and vulgar .
15,0,6,You know those upstarts . They're all show-offs ! I think I'd better have a diet ; otherwise I'd look like a ballon soon .
16,0,6,You're quite slim . In fact  if you were one of those starlets  the movie company would say you have a fabulous figure .
17,0,6,Thanks . I'm flattered .
18,2,6,Oh  my shoes pinch me . Let's find a seat and sit a while .

1,6,6,did you get my email ?
2,6,6,I certainly did . Do you want to come in and give me some feedback about your weekend ?
3,6,6,sure .
4,6,6,how did the business trip go ?
5,2,6,well  to be honest  nothing is more stressful than going on a business trip with our boss .
6,6,6,I understand . The last time I went on a business trip with the boss  I didn't even have enough to eat !
7,6,6,I also think the company is pretty cheap with travel expenses . I spent half of the weekend on a train ! Surely they could have afforded to buy a few plane tickets !
8,6,6,our company is quite conscious of the environmental problems that frequent flying causes .
9,2,6,I see . Well  then perhaps they could give me a few days off after a business trip . It was really tiring for me .
10,0,6,I can ask the boss about giving you the day off today .
11,0,6,thank you . I can't imagine getting much done today . I'm just too exhausted !
12,0,6,no problem . Did you bring any gifts back for your department ?
13,6,6,no  should I have ?
3624 8
 (2, 2),(4, 4),(6, 4),(8, 7),
1,6,6,What's the matter with you ? You look so upset and tired .
2,1,6,My father failed in business .
3,6,6,Oh  that's really tough .
4,1,6,Maybe it is the most difficult period of my family have experienced .
5,6,6,I can understand . By the way  is there anyway I can help ?
6,1,6,No  not now . I have found a part-time job . So perhaps I can help my family to come over the difficulties .
7,6,6,Oh  that's so great  bless you ! if you need me  I'll always be there .
8,0,6,Thank you .
3905 15
 (5, 4),(13, 11),(13, 12),(14, 13),(15, 14),
1,6,6,Hey  Maris  are you a part-timer ?
2,6,6,Part-timer ? Is that a new buzzword ?
3,6,6,Oh  it ' s pretty popular among my classmates these days . So are you ?
4,6,6,Sure  I have a part-time job as a bartender .
5,0,6,Cool ! It must be amazing to work at a bar !
6,6,6,Yeah  but I ' m not there for fun . I have to remain professional and if I get distracted  the manager would be pretty upset .
7,6,6,That ' s true . I ' m wondering did you learn anything from the job ?
8,6,6,Of course . There ' s always much to learn . I got to know more about the real world .
9,6,6,You mean you got working experience  right ?
10,6,6,Not just working experience . I would say the biggest lesson I learned is how to deal with people from all walks of life .
11,6,6,It must be very demanding .
12,6,6,Sometimes it is . But after working for a few weeks  it ' s easy to figure out .
13,3,6,Really ? It sounds interesting .
14,0,6,Maybe you can come to the bar one day and I ' ll show you around .
15,0,6,Great . I ' m looking forward to it .

2,0,6,Good morning  John !
3,0,6,I want to have a few friends over for a dinner party to celebrate my birthday . Would you be able to come the next weekend on Saturday ?
4,0,6,I'd be delighted to  John . Saturday did you say ?
5,0,6,Yes  if that's all right for you .
6,0,6,I'm pretty sure I'll be all right . In fact  I'd be delighted to come over and celebrate your birthday with you . What time are you planning to start ?
7,0,6,Oh  good . If you could come around six thirty or seven o'clock  that would give us some time to chat a whit over a glass of wine before dinner .
8,0,6,That sounds fine . I'll be there around seven .

2,3,6,Oh  how could it be ?
3,0,6,Let's go out and have a look .
4,0,6,OK . Wait a minute .
5,0,6,Look at the snow  it's so beautiful .
6,0,6,Yes . It's really snowing .
7,0,6,I love winter  I love snow .
8,6,6,But don't you think it's a little too cold ?
9,6,6,But I like cold more than hot .

5,0,6,I might try it myself .

1,0,6,Do you want to go out for dinner tonight ?
2,0,6,Sure . Have you got anywhere in mind ?
3,0,6,I'm starving  so maybe we could go somewhere with large portions .
4,0,6,That Italian restaurant in the city centre always has large portions . Do you want to go there ?
5,0,6,I'm not really in the mood for Italian  actually . I was thinking of something a bit spicy .
6,0,6,If you want spicy food  then I'd recommend going to a Thai  Indian or Chinese restaurant . How about that Chinese buffet on Cowley Road ?
7,0,6,I really like that restaurant ; you get a lot for your money there . But  they've westernized their food  so it's not actually that spicy .
8,0,6,You're right . Most of their dishes have sweet sauces . We could try that Indian restaurant just down the road from us .
9,0,6,The Taj ? They're a bit expensive  but they do serve large portions of very hot food .
10,0,6,The Taj it is then .
11,0,6,Shall we bring our own bottle of wine to save some money ?
12,0,6,They'll still charge us a corkage fee .
13,0,6,That's right . It'll probably work out to be about the same then anyway .
14,0,6,Don't worry about money . I'll treat you tonight .
15,3,6,Are you sure ? We could go Dutch .
16,0,6,No  I'll pay . It's my turn anyway . You paid last time .
17,0,6,I won't argue with that ! Let's go !

3,0,6,Yeah  I heard it's going to be a lot of fun .
4,3,6,Really ? Well  what time does it start ?
5,6,6,It starts at 8
6,6,6,Well  who all is going to be there ?
7,6,6,Everyone from school .
8,6,6,How do you know it's going to be so fun ?
9,0,6,This party is going to have a DJ  food  and drinks .
10,0,6,Wow  that does sound like it's going to be fun .
11,0,6,So am I going to see you at the party ?
12,0,6,Yeah  I will be there .

1,6,6,Hey Lydia  what are you reading ?
2,0,6,I ' m looking at my horoscope for this month ! My outlook is very positive . It says that I should take a vacation to someplace exotic  and that I will have a passionate summer fling !
3,6,6,What are you talking about ? Let me see that ... What are horoscopes ?
4,6,6,It ' s a prediction of your month  based on your zodiac sign . You have a different sign for the month and date you were born in . I was born on April 15th  so I ' m an Aries . When were you born ?
5,6,6,January 5th .
6,0,6,Let ' s see . . . you ' re a Capricorn . It says that you will be feeling stress at work  but you could see new  exciting developments in your love life . Looks like we ' ll both have interesting summers !
7,6,6,That ' s bogus . I don't feel any stress at work  and my love life is practically nonexistent . This zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense .
8,6,6,No  it ' s not  your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality . See ? It says that an Aries is energetic and loves to socialize .
9,6,6,Well  you certainly match those criteria  but they ' re so broad they could apply to anyone . What does it say about me ?
10,0,6,A Capricorn is serious-minded and practical . She likes to do things in conventional ways . That sounds just like you !

3,3,6,Really ? Where did you go ?
4,6,6,We went to Europe .
5,6,6,What cities did you go to ?
6,6,6,London  Paris and a few other cities .
7,6,6,Did you go to Berlin ?
8,6,6,No  We didn't go there . I'd like to go there next time .
9,0,6,I think this summer is a good time to visit Berlin . It's a beautiful place and the people there are very nice .
10,0,6,That's what I've heard .
11,0,6,I went there last year . If you want  I can give you some information I have about the city .

2,0,6,It's very nice . I haven't heard live music in a while . This is fun .
3,0,6,Well  then  may I invite you for the next dance ?
4,0,6,Of course . But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer ...
5,0,6,Don't worry . I'm not much of a dancer myself .
6,0,6,You're dancing so well .
7,0,6,You dance beautifully too .
8,0,6,When did you learn to dance ?
9,0,6,In college . But I don't dance very often . What's your favourite dance ?
10,0,6,It's hard to say . It depends . But I love the waltz .
11,0,6,How about tango ?
12,0,6,Oh  I like it . It's such a beautiful dance  but I can't do it well . What about you ?
13,0,6,Tango is my favorite . Anything but hip-hop or the foxtrot . ( the music has stopped )
14,0,6,Thank you for the dance .

2,0,6,I appreciate what you have done for me . Everything I have seen here has left a deep impression on me . I really don't know how to express my thanks to you .
3,0,6,We are ready to help you .
4,0,6,Will you be kind to say " Thank you " to Mr . Zhang and other friends for me ?
5,0,6,I'd like to . I'm sure your visit will help to promote the friendship and understanding between both of us . Welcome to China again .
6,0,6,Of course  I will . Well  it's time for me to say goodbye . The plane will take off soon . Hope some day you will come to America for a visit .

2,0,6,I'm glad you like it . The bell is on the bedside . Just ring if you want anything . The room attendant speaks a little English . So I don't think you'll have any trouble .
3,0,6,No  I shouldn't think so . By the way  is there a socket for my razor ?
4,6,6,I think so . Here it is . It ' s by the basin .
5,6,6,Is it a two-pin socket ?
6,6,6,Yes  it is .

1,6,6,Hi  Ann . I was wondering if you are free tomorrow night ?
2,6,6,Well  George . I guess I am . Why do you ask ?
3,6,6,I've just gotten a pair of pre-sale Star Wars movie tickets from a friend and was thinking of inviting you along for the opening premiere . Are you interested ?
4,0,6,Yeah  definitely ! Thanks for inviting me .
5,0,6,My pleasure .
6,6,6,I really wanted to watch the Star Wars on the opening day  but the pre-sale tickets were sold out . How did you manage to get hold of them ?
7,6,6,A friend of mine works at the corporate headquarters of Pepsi  which is a major sponsor of the movie . He was able to get the tickets for free  and then he sold two more for me for 50 dollars a piece .
8,3,6,You paid 50 dollars for each ticket ? That's a huge premium over the regular price .
9,6,6,Not really . Considering the fact that other people were willing to pay as much as 200 dollars each on the black market . Besides  I knew you were really looking forward to watching Star Wars on the opening day .
10,0,6,Wow ! I am really honored you went through all this trouble just for my sake . I really appreciate that . So  what time are we going ?
11,6,6,Well  let's see . The movie stars at 10 . We should be there at least 1 hour earlier  because there is a big line . I could pick you up at your house at 8  if that's ok with you .
12,6,6,8 pm  that's fine with me .
13,6,6,Okay .
14,6,6,So I'll see you tomorrow then at 8 .
15,6,6,Yeah  that's great . I'll see you tomorrow night .
16,6,6,Ok  George . Bye !

2,0,6,That would be great . Actually  can I get your phone number  Ella ? That's assuming you don't mind if I call you sometime .
3,0,6,Anytime . You can reach me at 5558929 .
4,0,6,Ok  got it . I will call you sometime next week .

1,0,6,I just got a telegram from Margaret and Greg .
2,0,6,Are they coming to Chicago again ?
3,0,6,Yes . They ' re coming the beginning of August .
4,0,6,Oh  good ! We can all get together again .
5,0,6,I ' m glad they ' re coming in August . Maybe Greg and I can play some golf or get tickets to a baseball game .
6,0,6,And Margaret and I can take the dog and go jogging in the park .
7,0,6,Remember the garden party they gave when we were in England ?
8,0,6,Oh  yes . We all sat on the grass  and Margaret played the guitar and sang Greek songs .
9,0,6,I had a great time . It ' ll be good to see them again .

1,6,6,Listen  Karen  I need your help . I don't know anyone here yet .
2,0,6,I'm glad to help you . What's wrong ?
3,1,6,My mother-in-law just went into the hospital in L . A . Hank and I will be flying there tonight .
4,1,6,I'm sorry to hear it . What's wrong with her ?
5,6,6,Doctors aren't sure yet . But the real problem is Suzy . She has a bad cold  and we don't want to take her with us . But we don't know who can stay with her .
6,6,6,You need a babysitter .
7,6,6,Yes  I'd ask Jill  the girl I've had before  but I need someone overnight . Maybe even for two nights .
8,6,6,I could have Suzy stay at my place .
9,6,6,I don't want to do that to you  Karen .
10,6,6,Why not ?
11,6,6,Your own kids would get Suzy's cold . I think it would be better to have a good babysitter here . But I don't know who to ask . I need someone more mature than Jill . It might even be for two or three days .
12,6,6,I know who we can ask . There is a girl I know  Sara Ralston . She is 17  and she will usually take this kind of job . I know her from my church  and I trust her completely .
13,6,6,I'd like to talk with her . This is short notice  I know . But Hank and I are leaving tonight .
14,6,6,I'll get you her number . I hope she can do it . She is very responsible .
15,0,6,I'm glad you know someone . I knew you would be the best person to ask about this . I don't want to insult Jill or her mother . I think Jill maybe could do it . But I'd rather have someone a little older .
16,6,6,I'll go home and get Sara's number . I'll call her first myself .
17,0,6,Great . Then call me and let me know if she's free .

1,6,6,Hi  Sara  what are you reading ?
2,6,6,Hi  John  I am trying to find a carpenter .
3,6,6,Why ?
4,6,6,Well  I want to build a deck in my back yard .
5,6,6,What for ?
6,6,6,So I can have a special place to hang out with friends  and also do some barbecuing on weekends .
7,0,6,That sounds cool . Do you mind if I recommend myself for the job ?
8,3,6,You ? Do you have a carpenter's license ?
9,0,6,Yes  of course . But I only freelance on weekends with my uncle .
10,3,6,Wow ! That's cool . So  let me give you some details about the deck I want .
11,0,6,Please go ahead  I am listening .
12,6,6,I'd like my deck to be at the same level as the back door .
13,6,6,Is your back door higher than the ground level ?
14,6,6,Yes  the back door is about four or five steps higher than the ground .
15,6,6,Okay  then you need a deck with a guardrail .
16,6,6,I don't like things to be fancy .
17,0,6,Don't worry . I will build your deck with a simple but classic look .
18,0,6,Hmm  that's good . Can you use cedar or redwood to build it ?
19,0,6,Cedar is a good choice .
20,0,6,Well  let's take the measurements right now .

 (1, 1),(2, 1),(2, 1),(2, 2),(3, 1),(3, 2),(4, 4),
1,0,6,Oh that ' s a lovely necklace .
2,0,6,Thank you . My husband gave it to me .
3,0,6,Oh I didn ' t know you were married .
4,0,6,Yes I am . I got married five years ago .
5,6,6,Oh I see . That ' s nice . Did you meet your husband at work ?
6,6,6,No  we met at university .

1,6,6,Hey  Robert  what are you doing this weekend ?
2,6,6,I didn't have any big plans .
3,0,6,We are putting together a birthday party for Mary .
4,0,6,That sounds like fun . Where will it be ?
5,0,6,We thought it would be fun to have a pool party at Jay's house .
6,0,6,Oh good ! Can I bring anything ?
7,0,6,We will be providing hot dogs  hamburgers  and cake  but people can bring side dishes .
8,0,6,I am assuming that the dress is casual .
9,0,6,Dress casually and bring your bathing suit !
10,0,6,Wonderful . Just e-mail me the time and date and I'll be there .

1,6,6,Craig  what do you do for work ?
2,6,6,I'm still a student .
3,6,6,What school do you go to ?
4,6,6,Boston University .
5,6,6,That's a good school . What do you study ?
6,6,6,I'm studying English  math  and history . My major is English .
7,6,6,How long have you been studying English ?
8,6,6,More than six years .
9,6,6,That's a long time .
10,6,6,Yeah  I started to learn English when I was in high school .
11,0,6,No wonder your English is so good .
12,0,6,Actually  it's not that good . I can read but I can't speak very well . I haven't had a lot of chance to practice .
13,0,6,I see . Talking with other people is very important .
14,0,6,Yes  but I still don't have many friends here yet .
15,0,6,I'm having a party tonight at my apartment . You should come .
16,0,6,Oh thanks for inviting me . I'd love to come .

1,0,6,Hey  that ' s a very nice hairdo you ' re wearing !
2,0,6,Oh you ' re exaggerating . I ' m never really good at making hairdo .
3,3,6,You did it yourself ? Wow  you are good !
4,0,6,Thanks for saying so  but my husband thinks otherwise .
5,0,6,He ' s just got no idea of how good you are .

1,6,6,Did you enjoy that new movie ?
2,6,6,That movie's just a lot of noise  same as Simon .
3,6,6,Oh  what happened  Carole ?
4,6,6,I had to go by myself  he couldn't make it .
5,3,6,What ? I met him just before I took off from Kitty's  he said he was coming .
6,6,6,Kitty's ? He sure gets around  doesn't he ?
7,6,6,Looks like it . So how did he handle it to ?
8,1,6,His excuse was familiar . He said his car died again .
9,6,6,I think that's a bunch of nonsense . It seemed ok to me .
10,1,6,I know . Last week he gave me a lie about being too busy .
11,6,6,Doesn't sound promising .
12,1,6,Well  I think it's the time to pull the plug .
13,6,6,If you want I'll let him know if I run into him .
14,0,6,Thanks anyway  but I'll do it  Rebecca . Let's get to class .

1,6,6,What are you doing this weekend ?
2,6,6,I am not sure . What are you doing ?
3,0,6,I was thinking of maybe taking a drive to the beach .
4,0,6,That sounds like a great idea !
5,0,6,Would you be interested in joining me ?
6,0,6,Sure  I would love to go with you . When would you be leaving ?
7,0,6,I thought that we could leave around 8
8,0,6,That would give us plenty of time to explore . Did you know that there is a music festival on the beach in Santa Barbara ?
9,0,6,That was part of my plan .
10,0,6,Well then  I'll see you on Saturday . Thanks for asking me to go with you .
4220 6
 (3, 2),(4, 3),(4, 4),(5, 4),(6, 5),
1,6,6,How are you feeling  John ?
2,6,6,Oh  not too bad  but I've got to stay in bed .
3,0,6,Do more exercises after you are healthy .
4,0,6,Ok  I will . You have said that many times .
5,0,6,Are you hungry ? Do you want me to buy something for you to eat ?
6,0,6,No  there ' s no need . Thank you all the same .

 (1, 1),(3, 3),(5, 3),(7, 3),(9, 3),(11, 3),(11, 11),
1,0,6,I want to try something different today .
2,6,6,What do you mean ?
3,0,6,I want a different hair style .
4,6,6,What style do you want ?
5,0,6,Can you make my hair short ?
6,6,6,Exactly how short do you want it ?
7,0,6,Make it a few inches long .
8,6,6,Are you sure you want me to cut it that short ?
9,0,6,I've been thinking about this for a while now .
10,6,6,Okay . I'll do it if you're positive that this is what you want .
11,0,6,I honestly want my hair that short .
12,6,6,All right  then let's begin .
5977 8
 (1, 1),(3, 3),(5, 4),(5, 5),
1,5,6,I've something very unpleasant to talk with you . Upon the arrival of the first consignment  it was found that about 50 % of the sixty cases of pineapples were leaking .
2,6,6,It's rather an unusual case . Have you found the cause of leaking ?
3,5,6,It ' s simply because the tins were damaged .
4,6,6,It appears to be the only case to us  that the goods have been damaged on the way .
5,5,6,I am sorry to say it's not on the way  but during loading . The tins inside the cases were broken evidently through rough handling .
6,6,6,Could you offer us a certificate issued by your Health Department ?
7,6,6,Certainly . Here you are . Our health authorities said they were no longer suitable for human consumption . I have to remind you that our terms are CIF Hamburg . I hope you would indemnify us for the loss  so it wouldn't be so heavy on us .
8,6,6,Now we are prepared to settle the issue with you amicably .

1,5,6,I don't know what to do about the people who live in the flat above me !
2,6,6,Why ? What are they like ?
3,5,6,They're incredibly selfish . They ' re always up until the wee hours of the night playing their music so loudly that I have to wear earplugs in order to fall asleep !
4,6,6,Have you ever talked to them about it ?
5,5,6,I tried to introduce myself to them when they moved in  but they were so arrogant that I didin't want to ever talk to them again !
6,6,6,What did they say ?
7,5,6,They both just talk about how great they are all the time .
8,5,6,They soud like the neighbours from hell !
9,5,6,They are ! Besides being loud and arrogant  they're also terrible gossips . They're always talking about everybody else in the apartment .
10,6,6,I thought you didn't talk to them much .
11,6,6,I don't  but they talk so loudly that I can hear what they're talking about from my bedroom - and it's not very nice .
12,6,6,What do the other people in your apartment think about them ?
13,6,6,Most of my other neighbours are scared of them .
14,6,6,Maybe you should think about moving .
15,2,6,I can't afford to move right now .
16,6,6,Well  perhaps you should have a party and try to get to know them better . Maybe once you get to know them  they'll turn out to be more sensitive .
17,2,6,I think you're being a bit optimistic . If you met them  you'd understand .
18,6,6,Well  I don't know what else you could do then . Do you think bribing them with chocolate would work ?
2425 9
 (1, 1),(2, 1),(3, 1),
1,2,6,I don ' t think I can take another semester of this dorm food .
2,2,6,I know what you mean  it leaves a lot to be desired .
3,2,6,Sure  like taste  variety  nutritional value  what I should do is move into an apartment off campus where I can cook for myself .
4,6,6,Have you found anything yet ?
5,6,6,You know how hard it is to find a decent place at this time of year ?
6,6,6,You should be able to find something comfortable in town  though that would be kind of far from school .
7,6,6,I got a car  so the distance wouldn ' t really be a problem .
8,6,6,But the parking might be .
9,6,6,You bet !

2,0,6,I'm not quitting yet . You know my favourite slogan  don't you ?
3,0,6,Yeah  I know . Shop till you drop .
4,0,6,Right !
5,0,6,I'm getting a little short on cash . Let's just window shop a little .
6,6,6,Ok .
7,0,6,Hey  Jeanine  get a load of that . It's beautiful .
8,0,6,Ahahah  and I thought you were tired .
9,0,6,You know .. I have a weakness for long dresses .
10,0,6,It sure looks special  looks expensive too .
11,0,6,Sure does . Hey  can I sponge a little cash of you ?
12,0,6,Don't worry  Mary  I've got you covered .
13,0,6,Thanks  Jeanine  you are a real pal . Let's go in .

1,0,6,Lucy  come here ! I can see the lake which is in the center of park .
2,0,6,It is beautiful ! Look  there are so many birds around it .
3,0,6,It is a great place for a relaxing vacation .
4,0,6,Listen to the sound of nature ! It's like music .
5,0,6,Yeah  I agree . It makes you feel really good .
6,0,6,What are those ?
7,0,6,Do you mean the red things ? They are roses .
8,0,6,I'm going to take more pictures today .
9,0,6,Me  too .

1,6,6,This is tough to say  Jordan  but I think we should break up .
2,3,6,Are you serious ?
3,6,6,Yes  I mean it .
4,3,6,But why ? Did I do anything wrong ?
5,6,6,No  we are just too different . This isn ' t working .
6,1,6,Hey  come on . It ' s too early to say that . We can fix things .
7,6,6,I have thought about it for a while . I think it ' s time to move on for both of us .
8,1,6,But I still love you .
9,6,6,I ' m sorry .
10,1,6,I knew this would happen some day ...
11,6,6,Then why didn ' t you talk to me ?
12,1,6,Well . It ' s not all my fault  Anna ...
13,6,6,I don't want to argue with you anymore . This is going to be tough  but Let ' s try and be friends .
14,1,6,I would like that Anna  but I think I ' ll need a little space for a bit .
15,6,6,I think we ' ll be better off if we are apart .
16,1,6,Shall we keep pur friendship ?
17,6,6,Sure  let ' s just be friends .

 (3, 3),(5, 5),(7, 5),(7, 7),(9, 5),(9, 7),(9, 9),
1,6,6,how's it going ?
2,6,6,I'm in a really good mood  actually . How about you ?
3,5,6,to be honest  I'm a bit fed up .
4,6,6,what's wrong ?
5,5,6,well  my boyfriend was supposed to call me last night  but he never did .
6,6,6,that's too bad . I'm sure there's a logical explanation for it . Don't be too upset about it .
7,5,6,the thing is  this isn't the first time he's promised to do something and then didn't .
8,6,6,I see how that can get a bit annoying .
9,5,6,a bit ? I'm extremely annoyed that he didn't phone me when he promised me that he would ! He's such a liar .
10,6,6,so what are you going to do about it ?
11,6,6,I don't know . I've got mixed feelings about it . On the one hand  I really want to end it with him  but on the other hand  I don't want to be without him .
12,6,6,what do you think would make you happier ?
13,6,6,in the long run  I think breaking up with him would make me much happier  but I know that I'll be depressed about it for a few weeks first .
14,6,6,relationships can be confusing sometimes .
15,6,6,what would you do if you were me ?
16,6,6,I'd call him and dump him now ! You deserve better than him !

2,0,6,I'm fine . How about yourself ?
3,0,6,I'm pretty good . Thanks for asking .
4,6,6,No problem . So how have you been ?
5,0,6,I've been great . What about you ?
6,0,6,I've been good . I'm in school right now .
7,6,6,What school do you go to ?
8,6,6,I go to PCC .
9,6,6,Do you like it there ?
10,6,6,It's okay . It's a really big campus .
11,0,6,Good luck with school .
12,0,6,Thank you very much .

1,0,6,It's wonderful to be in the mountains after a hustle bustle week .
2,0,6,Indeed . I love the smell of the grass and trees . They certainly refresh my mind .
3,0,6,Can we stop here for a while ? My backpack is very heavy .
4,0,6,Sure . Did you hear anything ? Look ! An eagle is hovering in the sky .
5,0,6,Let me see . It's not an eagle . I think it's a vulture .
6,0,6,Yes . Will it hurt us ?
7,0,6,I don't think so . Let's walk by the stream . I am sure we can find the waterfall on the map .
8,0,6,OK . I have a good pair of hiking boots . It should not be a big problem .
9,0,6,I also brought a bottle of water and some provisions . If you are hungry  you can let me know .
10,0,6,You are kind . Look there is a big tree over there  it looks like a thousand-year-old tree .
11,0,6,Well  it is a birch tree . It is not as old as you think .
12,6,6,How do you know ?
13,0,6,Because its trunk is not thick enough to be like a thousand-year-old tree .

1,6,6,Here ' s a letter for you .
2,6,6,Let me see it .
3,6,6,Who ' s the letter from ?
4,6,6,It ' s a letter from UCLA about my acceptance .
5,6,6,Read it !
6,0,6,UCLA accepted me !
7,3,6,Really ?
8,0,6,I ' m not joking . I got accepted !
9,0,6,I ' m so happy for you !
10,0,6,UCLA was my second choice  but I ' m happy knowing I ' Ve been accepted .
11,0,6,I am really proud of you .
12,0,6,You have no idea how proud I am of myself .
263 4
 (2, 2),(3, 2),(3, 3),(4, 2),
1,0,6,Hi  it is a pleasant surprise !
2,0,6,Yeah  it ' s been ages ! So how have you been ?
3,0,6,Couldn ' t be better . And you ?
4,0,6,Just as usual  you know .
2817 12
 (3, 2),(9, 8),(10, 9),
1,6,6,What's the bonus like at your company ?
2,6,6,Well  it's OK  I suppose . We get about the equivalent of six months ' salary .
3,3,6,Six months ' salary ? Are you serious ? That's incredible !
4,6,6,Maybe . But you'd be amazed at how little's left after the credit companies have deducted their share from my account .
5,6,6,Hey  I know what that's like . I bought a BMW on my Visa card . Now the payments really hurt .
6,6,6,Well  you're lucky that you're still able to make your payments . I missed a credit payment last month . Now my bank account's overdrawn  and the company is threatening to take back my purchases .
7,6,6,What did you buy ?
8,6,6,A new home health monitor .
9,3,6,Health Monitor ? I read an article about that racket . They ' re overpriced to begin with ! Listen  if I were you  I'd let them take back their monitor and spend my money on something more practical .
10,3,6,You're kidding !
11,6,6,No joke !

1,6,6,Hey Steve . When's the next time you're going to play golf ?
2,6,6,I'm going out this Saturday .
3,6,6,Do you already have a foursome ?
4,6,6,Unfortunately  we do . Let's plan for something together for Wednesday . We can go right after work .
5,6,6,That sounds good . Where do you want to play ?
6,6,6,We won't have much time  so let's play somewhere close to work .
7,6,6,How about Bellevue ? It's pretty close .
8,6,6,How much does it cost over there ?
9,6,6,Twilight rates are 21 dollars .
10,0,6,That's pretty good . Let's do it .
11,6,6,Aright . I'll get a tee time for Wednesday at about 4
12,6,6,Make it 4
13,0,6,Ok . I'll call you later when I get a tee time .
14,0,6,Sounds good . I'll see you on Wednesday then .
15,0,6,Aright . Have fun on Saturday .
16,0,6,Will do .

1,6,6,I like the Honda Accord you showed me before . I think it's more practical for my needs .
2,0,6,Alright  sir . You are making a good choice . Honda has made a lot of design improvements in the new Accord .
3,6,6,What does it come with standard ?
4,6,6,On all our new cars  the standards includeair conditioning  anti-lock brakes  air bags  and an AM / FM stereo with a CD player . But on the Accord  there is another standard item as well . The Accord com
5,6,6,Cruise control ? I don't like that .
6,3,6,Why not  sir ?
7,6,6,I think it's dangerous . What if I can't turn it off ?
8,6,6,Well  sir  I know some of our customers are concerned about cruise control . But Honda has never had a single cruise control malfunction that led to an accident .
9,6,6,I wish it didn't have cruise control . My wife doesn't like it either .
10,6,6,You know  sir  you don't have to use it . You can turn it on or off . If you don't want to use it  you just never turn it on .
11,6,6,I suppose . And what about the sunroof ? Is that standard ?
12,6,6,No  the sunroof is optional  sir .
13,6,6,I see . Another important question is the time I can get this car . I need a new car rather soon .
14,6,6,Well  I can say that the new models will be here in August . If you order one now  we will have it for you in August .
15,0,6,That's good enough  I think . What colors does the new Accord come in ?
16,6,6,We have this new model in red  white  black  or silver . These are the standard colors . Of course you could specially order from various other colors too .
17,6,6,My brother has last year's Accord . And his car is a kind of soft purple color mixed with silver . I really like that color . I wonder if I can get that color on my Accord .
18,6,6,I know the color you mean . Is this it  sir ?
19,6,6,Yes  I think that's it . Can I get that on the Accord ?
20,6,6,Yes  you can . That color is very popular with Honda buyers . So we've kept it available .
21,0,6,Well  I think I want to order the new Accord then . It looks like an excellent car .
22,0,6,You have made a good choice  sir . I drive an Accord myself . They are very solidly built machines  very reliable .
23,6,6,Yes  I know . I think Honda is the most reliable car on the road . I would never change to anything else . The Honda I have now almost never has service problems . It runs smooth as silk .
24,6,6,Alright  sir . I will get the paperwork ready for you . Just a moment .

1,6,6,Hello everyone  and welcome to our CPR for beginners course . First of all  does anyone know what CPR stands for ?
2,0,6,Cardiopulmonary resuscitation !
3,6,6,That ' s right ! We apply CPR in the case of cardiac arrest or pulmonary arrest .
4,6,6,What does that mean ?
5,6,6,Well  basically if your heart stops pumping blood  or your lungs stop pumping air  then we need to get them going again ! That ' s when we have to apply this procedure . Let ' s begin ! I need a volunteer .
6,3,6,Me ! Me !
7,6,6,Alright  come here and lay flat on your back . Let ' s suppose this young woman has stopped breathing . We must lift the person ' s chin so that we clear a pathway for air to get into the lungs . Then we place our mouth over the other person ' s mouth and blow air two or three times  like this .
8,3,6,Wait  what are you doing ? I ' m a married woman ! You can ' t just try to kiss me like this !
9,6,6,Madam I ' m not trying to kiss you ! I am trying to demonstrate how to apply CPR in the case of an emergency .
10,6,6,Well  OK . But no French kissing !
11,6,6,As I was saying  we blow air through the mouth in this manner . Once this is done  we must try to get the heart going again . To do this  we place our hands over the person ' s chest  and press down firmly two or three times .
12,3,6,Wait  what are you doing ! You can ' t just kiss me then go for second base !

4,6,6,He was a very easy teacher . Are you thinking of taking a class with him ?
5,6,6,I'm not sure because I really need to learn something  but I also worry about grades .
6,6,6,Grades are important  but don't you think that gaining the knowledge is important  too ?
7,0,6,I really need to learn this stuff .
8,6,6,He made everything so interesting that the time just flew by . Do you know what I mean ?
9,0,6,Yes  that sounds right for me .
10,6,6,Did you know that he came here last year after 10 years in the military ?

3,3,6,How gross ! I can ' t handle people like that . Does he at least give you a hand around the house ?
4,5,6,He doesn ' t lift a finger ! I bend over backwards cleaning up all day and he sleeps in until noon .
5,6,6,Man  what a freeloader . You better do something quick or he ' ll never hit the road . After all  he ' s got it made in the shade here .
6,3,6,You think he might stay even longer ? !
7,6,6,Now  don ' t go losing your temper . If you tolerated all you can  just kick him out ... but do it with gloves . I know ! Tell him a white lie like you ' re getting the house fumigated !

2,6,6,That's about five blocks . And around corners too . So he was definitely following you .
3,4,6,Yes  he was . I'm not imagining it . Finally  just when I got home  I turned around and looked at him . He was just standing there . He didn't smile . He just stood there . It was so obvious . What should I do ? I'm so scared . Can I call the police ?
4,6,6,Actually  I don't think you can call the police . Not yet at least . He hasn't done anything . And probably the police will just ignore it . But if anything happens again  then maybe you should call .
5,4,6,Why can't I call the police now ? He was definitely following me !
6,6,6,Of course you can call the police if you want . That's not what I mean . I'm just saying that they probably won't do anything .
7,4,6,I suppose . What can they do ? I don't even know who he is .
8,6,6,Listen  Carol . Don't let this bother you too much . Probably it's nothing . Just keep your eyes open when you go out . If you see him a third time  and if he follows you again  then I think we should go to the police . But for now  just try not to worry .
9,6,6,Alright . And I won't go to that cafe for awhile .

12,6,6,I don't know . He's a little depressed . He's having a hard time finding a job right now .

5,6,6,I don ' t think she will do such a thing .
6,1,6,But she did and made me disappointed .
7,6,6,Oh  cheer up . A girlfriend is not everything .
8,1,6,But she means a lot to me .
9,6,6,Then forgive her mistake .
10,1,6,Oh . I just can ' t forget it .

2,0,6,There are three of them  the Three Tenors .
3,0,6,Oh  you mean Pavarotti  Domingo and Carreras . Have you been to their live shows ?
4,0,6,Yeah  it's really a unique experience . It's a solo concert by Pavarotti . He put on the performance in the Forbidden City in Beijing .
5,0,6,I've heard of that one . It was also his swan song .
6,0,6,Besides  speaking of classical music  we should never forget about the New Year's Concert .
7,0,6,Of course not . People all over the world watch it on TV  or listen to it on the radio .
8,0,6,Sure . It's undoubtedly one of the biggest classical music events . Have you ever been to the live show ?
9,0,6,Yes  I went to the New Year's Concert in 2005 .
10,0,6,Wow  you are so lucky . I saw that one on TV . But it must be so different to be there in the concert hall .
11,0,6,That's for sure . You know  it's really amazing to be in the best concert hall  listening to the performance by the best orchestra . I had the greatest time ever .
12,0,6,Who was the conductor at that event ?
13,0,6,Lorin Maazel . He did an amazing job . Moreover  he just celebrated his 75th birthday .
14,0,6,So cool . I wish I can go to the live New Year's Concert someday in the future .
15,0,6,The right opportunity for you would come along soon . You know  music is transnational .
16,0,6,I believe in that . Well  the performance is about to begin . Let's be quiet .

6,0,6,It ' s fine . I am actually from Mexico . I was in China on a business trip  visiting some local companies that manufacture bathroom products .
7,0,6,Wow sounds interesting ! Excuse me if I am being a bit nosy but  how old are you ?
8,6,6,Don ' t you know it ' s rude to ask a lady her age ?
9,6,6,Don ' t get me wrong ! It ' s just that you seem so young and already doing business overseas !
10,0,6,Well thank you ! In that case  I am 26 years old  and what about yourself ?
11,6,6,I am 40 years old and was born and raised here in the good old U . S of A  although I have some Colombian heritage .
12,3,6,Really ? That ' s great ! Do you speak some Spanish ?
13,6,6,Uh ... yeah .. of course !

2,6,6,What ' s wrong ? That was a great goal .
3,3,6,Yes  but I bet $ 200 dollars on the Cougars !
4,6,6,Looks like you ' re going to lose out on this game then .
5,3,6,I can ' t believe it ! I thought the Cougars were going to win for sure .
6,6,6,What were the odds ?
7,3,6,20 to 1  in favour of the Cougars !
8,6,6,Too bad .

7,0,6,Typical you  always wanting to keep the best things for yourself . The more I appreciate the gift now .

1,6,6,Here ' s your hot dog and beer . What happened ? Did I miss anything ?
2,6,6,Yeah  Cal Ripen just hit a home run .
3,6,6,What ' s the score ?
4,6,6,Well it was 3 to 4  but Ripen ' s home run made it 5 to 4 since another player was on first base .
5,6,6,So Baltimore is winning ?
6,0,6,Right .
7,0,6,This is a really great place to watch a baseball game .
8,0,6,Yeah  there isn ' t a bad seat in the place .
9,0,6,The fans are great here  too . Not like in Philadelphia .
10,0,6,It was a great idea to spend a day watching a game .

1,0,6,What a pin-up she is !

4,0,6,Absolutely . She ' s a teacher of aerobics .

 (6, 5),(6, 6),(8, 7),(11, 10),
1,6,6,I heard that Janet has got a new job . She ' s working for the united investment group . I heard that they pay very well .
2,6,6,I heard that too . She must be making a pocket . Well  good for her .
3,6,6,Now  she ' ll be able to save up for that holiday in the united states .
4,6,6,Yes  she will . At the moment  the exchange rate is very favorable  so she should try to go as soon as possible  while it ' s cheaper .
5,6,6,You ' re right . By the way  did you hear that Tom inherited some money recently ?
6,3,6,Really ? I thought his parents had died several years ago .
7,6,6,They did . He inherited the money from an uncle . I hope he doesn ' t lose a lot of it in taxed to the government .
8,3,6,Dying can be very expensive nowadays ! What ' s he going to do with it ?
9,6,6,He said that he would probably invest most of it . He ' s got a well-paid job  so he doesn ' t need the money to cover day-to day expenses . He just wants some extra money available for when he retires .
10,6,6,I had some good financial news yesterday too .
11,3,6,Really ? Have you won a fortune in the lottery ?
12,6,6,No  but I got a pay rise of 5 % and a bonus for all the hard work I ' Ve put in recently . I think it was very nice for my boss to show his appreciation in that way .
13,6,6,It certainly was ! So  what are you going to do with your windfall ?

1,0,6,Rose  the weekend is coming . Let's discuss what we will do .
2,0,6,What about going to the zoo on Saturday and to the park on Sunday ?
3,0,6,Sounds good . But on Saturday there's a football final .
4,6,6,Then  what shall we do on Sunday .
5,0,6,Let me see . We can visit the country . We haven't done that for such a long time .
6,0,6,Good idea . I'll go shopping in one of the department stores nearby . We'll go to the zoo and the park another time . After all  we can put that off .
7,0,6,OK .

 (3, 2),(3, 3),(4, 4),(6, 6),(7, 6),(7, 7),
1,6,6,What do you do when you are angry ?
2,6,6,I usually calm down first and think about the reason that caused my anger .
3,0,6,That ' s smart . What do you usually do to relieve your anger ?
4,0,6,Something like listening to music is a good idea .
5,6,6,Oh  what kind of music do you listen to ?
6,0,6,Classic . Something that could calm your mind .
7,0,6,I think that might work for me as well .
8,6,6,Working out is another good way to relieve anger .
9,6,6,Like what ?
10,6,6,Jogging  yoga  or even just taking a walk .
2475 12
 (2, 2),(3, 2),(6, 2),(6, 6),
1,6,6,Hi  Doris . You look a little bit down . What's the matter ?
2,1,6,Well  I'm leaving Japan and I'm going back to London  tomorrow .
3,3,6,Really !
4,6,6,Yeah .
5,6,6,How do you feel about that ?
6,1,6,Well  I do feel quite down because I am going to miss Japan after being here for 9 months  in Japan . I am going to miss it so much  cause I've had a great time here .
7,6,6,Mm  so what are you going to miss about Japan ?
8,6,6,Oh  I am going to miss the people  the food  the night life . Especially the nightlife .
9,6,6,What especially about the night life are you going to miss ?
10,6,6,Well  I really like dancing . And I enjoy going out to night clubs and to restaurants and eating Japanese food also and I'm really going to miss that because it's very different to London .
11,6,6,How are the clubs different in Japan than in London ?
12,6,6,Well  here there are many different clubs you can get into  for free  you don't have to pay  some of them . In London it's really expensive for drinks and an entry fee .

1,6,6,Can you believe the headlines ?
2,6,6,What are you reading ?
3,6,6,I ' m reading about Michael Milliken  the Bond King .
4,6,6,Didn ' t he sell worthless stocks to people or something ? He got arrested for that  didn ' t he ?
5,6,6,He got arrested all right .
6,2,6,If I remember  he got off with a light sentence . Something like three years in a minimum-security prison .
7,2,6,Yup  that ' s him . He made millions of dollars selling bonds to people and ended up with a pile of cash when they became useless .
8,2,6,I think the government fined him a small amount  and he kept the rest in his foreign bank accounts . He ' s still a millionaire .
9,2,6,That ' s the kind of thing in America that gets me mad . Some guy pulls off a stock scheme and makes millions while spending the bare minimum sentence in jail .
10,6,6,I know . And some poor guy that robs a liquor store makes $ 500 at most and ends up in jail for five to ten years .

1,6,6,Hi  John  how was your vacation ?
2,0,6,Awesome  we went to Australia and New Zealand .
3,6,6,That must have been wonderful . Do anything interesting ?
4,0,6,Well  we went bungee jumping when we were in Australia .
5,6,6,Wow ! Isn ' t that dangerous ?
6,6,6,A little  but the rush was worth it .
7,6,6,Tell me about it .
8,6,6,We jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us .
9,3,6,500 feet ! I would never be able to do that .
10,0,6,Yeah  It was scary  but exhilarating .

 (2, 2),(3, 2),(3, 3),(4, 2),(6, 6),(8, 7),
1,6,6,Tom  you look thoughtful and unhappy recently . What's wrong with you ?
2,1,6,Lily broke up with me last week . In fact  she dumped me .
3,3,6,Why ? I mean  why did she part company with you after seven years together ?
4,1,6,She said it was because we had very different ideas about life .
5,6,6,Do you believe her excuse ?
6,1,6,Of course not . I knew she had fallen in love with another guy . It is difficult to see her move on so quickly .
7,6,6,Come on  buddy  cheer up . Why not do some sports with me ? Violent exercise might help to shake you out of your disappointment in love .
8,0,6,Thank you  Steven . You are really a good friend .

2,0,6,I see . You are in luck this month because all of our models are on sale ! it is a perfect time to buy a new car since it ' s the end of the year .
3,0,6,Perfect ! I like this one .
4,6,6,That is the Ford Focus . A very light but powerful vehicle . It comes with dual side airbags  power steering and power windows  tinted windows and your choice of either automatic or manual transmission .
5,0,6,Sounds like a good car ! How many miles to the gallon ?
6,6,6,It is a very fuel efficient vehicle giving you about 34 miles in the city and 40 on the highway .
7,0,6,That is really convenient . Especially now that fuel prices are so high ! What ' s under the hood ?
8,0,6,A very powerful 2 . 5- liter turbocharged engine  Trust me  this car is fast !
9,6,6,Now for the most difficult question . What is the price tag for this lovely vehicle ?
10,6,6,Very affordable sir . You can take it out of this lot today with 0 % down payment and no interest for the first year ! You can test drive it now and we can sign the papers when we get back .
11,0,6,Great ! Let ' s do it !

2,6,6,Okay ! What do you suggest ?
3,0,6,How about seeing a play ? I hear Hamlet is on at the National Theater .
4,0,6,Is that so ? Why not ?
5,3,6,( looking at a newspaper ) Oh  dear me ! There's no performance at the National theater this weekend . So we have to go to cinema instead .
6,6,6,What's on ?
7,6,6,Let me see .. um . Gone With the Wind . It is on at six cinemas on Saturday night .
8,6,6,That sounds interesting . Which is the nearest ?
9,6,6,Ah . The Royal  I think .
10,6,6,What time does it start ?
11,6,6,Why don't we go to the 7:30 show ? It is convenient to us  I think .
12,6,6,But we won't have enough time for dinner .
13,6,6,Do you want to go to the earlier or the later show ?
14,6,6,Ah ... I fancy going to the later show .
15,6,6,Then  there's a 9:30 show .
16,0,6,That's Okay  I think .
17,0,6,All right .

6,6,6,It doesn't fit quite right . It feels a little tight in the waist . Do you have this in a larger size ?
7,6,6,Yes  here it is .

5,6,6,What's playing at the Century Fox ?
6,6,6,Candlelight in the Window
7,0,6,Should we go see it ?
8,6,6,I'd rather not . I don't like horror movies .
9,0,6,How about ' Run of the Mill ? '
10,6,6,No . I heard that's really boring .
11,0,6,Why don't we go to a concert instead ?

6,6,6,I don't know . Wait . Is this yours ?
7,3,6,No ! Oh  my God ! Someone has broken into the house .
8,6,6,It looks that way . That's probably why the door wasn't locked when we came in .
9,6,6,I locked it when I left though .
10,6,6,Yes  but the robber broke in . Then  when he left  he left through the door . So it wasn't locked .
11,5,6,I don't care about that  Allen ! What did he steal ? That's the question !
12,6,6,Look around .
13,6,6,The TV's still here .
14,6,6,And your stereo too . So what did he steal ? We have to go look upstairs .

2,6,6,No . We broke up last month . I ' m taking a break from dating for a while .
3,6,6,Did you break up amicably ? Sometimes couples row a lot before splitting up .
4,6,6,We just decided to stop seeing each other . It was all very amicable . Are you still going out with mike ?
5,0,6,Yes  I am . We ' re thinking about getting engaged . We ' Ve been dating for over a year now .
6,0,6,Good for you ! Have you seen Kelly recently ? Is she still dating nick ?
7,6,6,I havn't seen her for a while . She stopped seeing nick because he was cheating on her . He was seeing a girl form his office . One day  she saw them holding hands and ended the relationship immediately .
8,6,6,She was right to do that . I heard the Neil and Tina getting married soon .

9,6,6,That's normal for anyone with a newborn .
10,6,6,Yeah  but it's so hard . I have to work  and then go home and take care of my wife and the baby . I'm going to get sick at this rate .
11,6,6,You'll get used to it . After everything stabilizes  you can regain your health .

2,0,6,Pretty good . Mary  I was wondering if you would like to come to a party on Friday night ?
3,0,6,I am free that night  and a party sounds good .
4,0,6,Fine . It will be at my house . Do you know how to get there ?
5,0,6,I kind of know where you live  but could you e-mail me your address ?
6,0,6,I can do that . Do you have anyone that you would like to bring with you to the party ?

1,6,6,Good game ?
2,6,6,Not bad . But too hot for me today .
3,6,6,Yes  I know . Kind of hard to concentrate  isn't it ?
4,6,6,Absolutely . Who were you playing with ?
5,6,6,Oh  just on my own . I just joined  so I don't really have any partners .
6,3,6,Really ? Oh  well  in that case we should play together some time . What's your handicap ?
7,6,6,16 . Yours ?
8,0,6,No kidding ! I'm 16  too . We should definitely play together some time . My name's Bob .
9,0,6,Jane . Nice to meet you .
10,0,6,Me too . So  do you like the course ?
11,6,6,Yes  it's fine . However  I personally think the fairways between the greens are a bit too long  especially for such a hot climate . Don't they have carts ?
12,6,6,Well  they used to  but they got rid of them because of environmental concerns .
13,0,6,Oh  that's good . I guess the caddies were pleased .
14,6,6,Actually  in my opinion  the carts were better because you don't have to tip them .
15,6,6,Yes  but look at it this way  getting rid of the carts probably gives more work to local people  which is a good thing  right ?
16,6,6,Possibly  but I still miss them ! What bothers me is that the heat makes the caddies ' life quite hard . One member's caddy fainted last week !
17,6,6,How awful  poor guy .
18,6,6,Right . Luckily it was on the eighteen hole  quite near the clubhouse  so he didn't have far to carry him .
19,3,6,Oh  my God  you're kidding me ! He carried him back ?
20,6,6,Yup .

1,0,6,You must like negotiating a lot . People are saying  you are a super negotiator .
2,0,6,Ha  I am flattered . Actually  when it comes to negotiate  you don ' t need to like it . You just need to understand how it works .
3,0,6,I am not good at it by any means . Give me some advice .
4,0,6,Well  generally speaking  if you want to change someone ' s mind or understand his position  you have to put yourself in his shoes . Understand his need and the cost for his need . And then you work together to find a solution .
5,6,6,Sounds easy . But how can I apply to practice ? I am thinking about applying for more reimbursement for my mobile bill . But I am afraid our boss will turn me down .
6,6,6,Ok  as John after Kennedy put it  let us never negotiate out of fear  but let us never fear to negotiate .

8,0,6,You have a perfect taste !
9,0,6,It is the symbol of laughing at hoar frost and fighting with snow . I admire the bravery of plum blossoms .
10,6,6,But it used to be ignored by many people .

2,2,6,I get antsy not because you praise a guy  but because you may be taken for a ride by a guy like him .
3,6,6,How come you think of him that way ?
4,2,6,Because you seem to have lost your vigilance . You should be on the watch out .
5,6,6,I have no reason to distrust him . He's never caused any harm .
6,5,6,Isn't there anything that sounds fishy ?
7,6,6,Nothing smells a rat . I told you that he's an all-right guy .

1,6,6,Mary  how was your date with John ?
2,0,6,It ' s OK . It seems we have a lot in common .
3,3,6,Oh  really ? That is great news . What does he look like ?
4,0,6,He is tall and slim  fair-haired .
5,0,6,Sounds like he is pretty cute . What do you think of him ?
6,0,6,He is a nice guy and very considerate . I am impressed with how smart and humorous .
7,0,6,Oh  it ' s love at first sight .

2,1,6,My friend and I was argued with each other . For this  I ' m very sad . Because I don ' t want to lose this friend .
3,1,6,Oh  I ' m sorry to hear that . I know how you feel . Please don ' t be sad .
4,1,6,Thank you  but I really want to relax myself . I ' m very sorry .

1,5,6,What are we going to do ? I can't get the car out of this ditch . I'm stuck !
2,6,6,I'm worried  Tom . I haven't seen any other cars for almost an hour .
3,5,6,I know . This is terrible . What can we do ? This snow doesn't stop falling !
4,6,6,I told you we should have stayed in town today . The weather report said 100 percent chance of snow . Why did you want to come up here ?
5,6,6,I wanted to show you the cabin . We only had another half-hour to go .
6,6,6,Well  now we're stuck . What can we do ?
7,6,6,I don't know .
8,6,6,I've heard that when this happens  it's important to save energy .
9,6,6,What do you mean ?
10,6,6,We're stranded here  Tom . We may be here a long time . We need to conserve the gas in the car . The car's energy is what will keep us warm .
11,6,6,I have plenty of gas .
12,6,6,Yes  but the gas and the battery both have to stay working . We can't just let the car run and run . If we do  it will die soon . Then we'll freeze .
13,6,6,So what can we do ?
14,6,6,Turn the lights off . Then  run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . That will conserve the heat as long as possible .
15,0,6,Alright . That's a good idea .
16,6,6,I wish we hadn't come up here . Now we'll probably be here for days .
17,3,6,Days ?
18,6,6,Yes  it happens . That is what happens in big snowstorms . People get stranded for days .
19,0,6,Oh  my God ! It's good we have food .
20,6,6,Probably we'll survive . But turn the car off for about forty-five minutes . Then we'll turn it on again .
21,6,6,Okay  I'll follow your advice .

2,5,6,Fine  just get it ! We have been shopping for furniture for five hours ! I ' m so tired !
3,6,6,We still need to find an armoire and a dresser .
4,0,6,Fine ! I am going to go home and drop off this nightstand  coffee table and love seat while you look for the rest of the things .
5,0,6,Great ! Pick me up in about an hour because I think I ' ll also get a bean bag and a dining set .
6,6,6,While you are at it can you pick out a nice recliner ? I really want one so I can watch TV .
7,3,6,Recliner ? In my beautifully decorated living room ? I don ' t think so !

3,0,6,Yes  their new album just came out last week . It is number one on the billboard .
4,0,6,I really love their dancing . They are all excellent dancers .
5,0,6,The lyrics of the new song are beautiful  too . Can you sing ?

2,0,6,I know . It's going to be so much fun .
3,0,6,I always get excited the day before .
4,0,6,I used to be like that . But I go skiing so often that I don't get excited anymore .
5,0,6,I only go skiing twice a year  so it's a real treat for me .
6,0,6,That makes sense .
7,0,6,What things make you excited ?
8,0,6,Whenever I go to Vegas  I get really excited .

5,6,6,Like what ?
6,6,6,I went sailing  fishing  and horseback riding .

1,0,6,I have a sweet tooth . I can not help but think about having something sweet between meals .
2,0,6,A new candy shop just opened around the corner last week . They have a variety of candies and it is always full of people .
3,0,6,That sounds really attractive . Let's go to that candy shop now .
4,3,6,Are you serious ? It is always crowded with many people .
5,0,6,why not ? I would like to buy some candies . Since there are so many people  I think they must have delicious candy .
6,0,6,Look at the candy bar over there . It is so colorful and tasty .
7,0,6,They have lollypops  chocolate drops  fruit candy  mints  pearbrittles and toffee . They are in different colors and flavors .
8,0,6,I want to get a big bag and buy a little of everything .
9,0,6,Me too . I finally understand why a small shop like this can always befilmed with dozens of people .
10,0,6,To be honest  I care only about whether I can have some delicious candy eat . I couldn't care less about whether the shop is popular or not .
11,0,6,You are a candy terminator . Be careful or you'll get a lot of cavities .
12,0,6,That is true . Speaking of cavities  I am starting to feel something is wrong with my teeth now . Let's get more strawberry chocolate drops before we go home .
13,0,6,You really can't live without candy .

5,0,6,Thank you very much !
6,0,6,How are your cases coming along ?
7,0,6,Very well  thanks  I will probably finish next week  but this is still a lot of work  I have been worked on in for six months  and i ' m so closed to end . I can feel it .
8,0,6,Wow  Good for you . It sounds like a lot of work . I'm proud of you ! Is this the right building ?

1,6,6,Ah ! It hurts . Don't touch it .
2,6,6,What part hurts ?
3,6,6,The shoulder .
4,6,6,Well  maybe you broke it . But what I'm worried about is this cut .
5,4,6,It's not a cut . It's a gash ! It's bigger than a cut ! Ah ! I need a doctor .
6,6,6,C'mon . Just don't move .
7,4,6,I'm bleeding too much .
8,6,6,We don't have a decent First Aid Kit  do we ?
9,4,6,Yes . My bike has one under the seat . Get it  quick !
10,6,6,There's some tape  iodine  and cloth bandages . I don't think the cloth bandages can stop the bleeding . What we need is a tourniquet .
11,6,6,Wrap a few loops of the bandages around my upper arm  then twist . That will work as a tourniquet . After that  you can cut more of the bandages to cover the wound .
12,6,6,Good plan . Let me put some iodine on the cut .
13,4,6,No  forget that ! Do the tourniquet first . I'm losing too much blood .
14,6,6,Alright  alright . How did you cut this so bad ?
15,6,6,I ran it against that fence pole as I crashed . What do you think ? Damn  it hurts !
16,6,6,We'll have to get you to a hospital . I can ride you on the back of my bike .
17,6,6,I'm lucky I wasn't killed . I must have been going around forty-five miles an hour . There was too much gravel on that corner . I slid out .
18,6,6,Yes  I almost slid too . Alright . This tourniquet is tight . How does it feel ?
19,6,6,Make it tighter . I want the blood stopped . Then wrap some bandages around the cut . Then we can go . Ouch ! I hope I can walk .
20,6,6,Alright  I'm twisting it around . You tell me when to stop .
21,6,6,There . Stop !

3,2,6,It looks like some kind of primitive form of torture .
4,5,6,You're such a wimp ! You're afraid of an eyelash curler .
5,5,6,Well  you might pinch your eyelid ! Or lose an eyeball !
6,6,6,It just makes my eyelashes curl upwards .

6,6,6,Which one is that ?
7,6,6,You know  the one just on the corner with Oxford Street . There is a large pharmacy next door .
8,0,6,Oh yes  I know which one you mean . I have never been there  but I looked at their menu once and it did look good .
9,0,6,Okay then . I think we will all meet outside ?

2,0,6,Yes . Look at these historical relics here  amazing !
3,6,6,Why are they all in glass boxes ?
4,6,6,For protection . Some relics will turn to dust if exposed to air .
5,6,6,So there isn't air in the glass boxes ?
6,6,6,No  there isn't . There is a vacuum in every box .
7,6,6,I wonder how old these things are . Thousands of years ?
8,0,6,Yeah  they all come from a very ancient time .

9,1,6,I'm so sorry  I .. I didn't realize it was that loud .
10,6,6,It was that loud  and it was pretty late  and check with Mary if you don't believe me .
11,6,6,It's true . It was a bit loud .
12,6,6,I'm very sorry . I didn't realize it . I promise I'll keep it down in the future .

2,6,6,I know that they are auspicious fish . It's quite popular nowadays .
3,5,6,For God's sake ! It's too bloody . How can people be so cruel ?
4,6,6,Not at all . I think the tattoos are so cool and chic .
5,5,6,You can't prick the fish to please the sick tastes of some bloody people .
6,6,6,Honey  it's not so serious . It's just an animal .
7,5,6,Just an animal ? But it has life too . If you want a tattoo  get one . It's your choice because you want it . But has anyone asked the fish if it wanted one ?

1,0,6,How time flies !
2,0,6,Bill and Betty have already grown up .
3,0,6,I can still remember our first date .
4,0,6,Look at that big tree over there .
5,0,6,Yeah  oh my god ! It ' s still there . We have our first date right on there .
6,0,6,Do you know that I fell in love with you at the first sight then ?
7,0,6,You seemed to be dull at that time .
8,0,6,But you agreed to go out with me at last .
9,0,6,( Smile ) I can ' t believe this for it ' s been 20 years since we got married .
10,0,6,So do you feel happy now ?
11,0,6,I couldn ' t have been any happier !
12,0,6,Of course  we are the happiest family in the world .

1,0,6,I heard you were on a date last night ! So  how did it go ? I want all the juicy details !
2,0,6,Um ... well  actually  we had a fantastic time last night . He was ... amazing !
3,6,6,Okay  now you really have to fill me in . What ' s he like ?
4,0,6,He ' s really good looking  he ' s quite tall  around 6 ' 1 "  he ' s in his early thirties  and he ' s got the most beautiful dark brown eyes ...
5,0,6,He sounds hot ! What does he do for a living ?
6,0,6,You know what  this is the best part . David is a junior investment banker at Fortune Bank  so he ' s got a great career path ahead of him !
7,6,6,Hold on a sec  his name is David ?
8,6,6,Yeah ?
9,6,6,That ' s my brother !

 (2, 1),(2, 2),(3, 2),(4, 1),(4, 2),
1,0,6,Do you feel like going to see a movie tonight ?
2,0,6,I'd like that very much .
3,0,6,How does 7:30 sound ?
4,0,6,Fine . See you later .

1,0,6,I'll always remember my college days .
2,6,6,Oh yeah ?
3,0,6,It was one of the best times in my life . It was tough  but I made it . I became a college graduate .
4,6,6,How did you feel when you graduated ?
5,0,6,It was a round day for me . My family attend the graduation ceremony . I was so nervous . I couldn't find my cap and gown  but all worked out in the end .
6,6,6,What did you do after graduation ?
7,0,6,I was planning to attend gradate school  but then I was offered a good job doing marketing  so I changed my mind .
8,0,6,Sounds like you're happy with your decision .
9,0,6,I sure am . So what about you ? How did you feel when you graduated ?
10,6,6,It was also a proud day for me  but I also felt like a kind of loss that day .
11,6,6,How could it be ?
12,6,6,While seeing others going to work or continue their study  I didn't know what I would do .
13,6,6,You didn't have an offer ?
14,6,6,I had one  but I didn't like the job very much . I wanted to attend graduate school  but I was afraid it would be too tough .
15,6,6,I think you lack in the power of decision . Once you make your decision  don't be overtaken by misgivings and fear . Just go full steam ahead !

1,0,6,What a lovely day . The sun is shinning and the sky is so blue . It's a perfect day to go to the beach and get a beautiful tan .
2,0,6,Great idea . Unlike you  I just want to enjoy watching the sea and playing with the sand . I do not want to get a tan because I look good in pale skin .
3,0,6,Come on . Getting a tan symbolizes health and wealth in western countries .
4,0,6,While the pale color symbolizes beauty and elegance in most Asia countries .
5,0,6,That is a really interesting fact .
6,0,6,I will bring a big hat and apply a lot of sunscreen before setting off the beach .
7,0,6,Just do whatever you feel like doing .
8,0,6,( At the beach ) My bag is so heavy . Let's put the stuff under the tree .
9,0,6,Good idea . It is always cooler in a shade .
10,0,6,I can't wait to play in the water . My feet are burning when I stand on the sand .

 (3, 3),(5, 5),(6, 6),(9, 9),
1,6,6,What are you doing ?
2,6,6,I ' m just looking at this map of the world . I ' m preparing for a geography class .
3,3,6,There are no countries marked on the map .
4,6,6,No  there aren ' t . this map just show the geographical features . Look at the Himalayan plateau with the highest peaks in the world .
5,3,6,The thing that I find most surprising is that most of the world is covered with water . Compared to the oceans  most countries are tiny .
6,3,6,I find it incredible how millions of years of volcanic activity have created mountains thousands of metres tall .
7,6,6,Rivers have created deep valleys and canyons like the grand can you .
8,6,6,The oceans and landscapes all influence our climate .
9,0,6,It ' s all so interesting . I ' ll have to find more information about it on the internet . Or perhaps I should try and attend your geography class .

 (4, 4),(5, 4),(6, 5),(8, 7),(8, 8),
1,6,6,Are you excited about your trip next month ?
2,6,6,Yes and no . I can ' t wait to go to Europe  but at the same time I am terrified .
3,6,6,Why ?
4,4,6,Well  I have acrophobia . I have a chronic fear of flying .
5,3,6,Oh really ? I have an uncle who is also terrified of flying . It ' s not that bad though  I mean  it is pretty scary to be in this big machine flying through the air at seven hundred miles per hour . I actually have arachnophobia .
6,3,6,You ' re scared of spiders ? I actually have two more phobias . Acrophobia and glossophobia .
7,6,6,I guess that explains why you are afraid of flying  but public speaking is not that bad .
8,3,6,Are you kidding ? When I get on stage  my palms start to sweat  I get really nervous and I can hardly speak .
9,6,6,Well  I must confess I am a bit claustrophobic . I hate being in an elevator for more than 5 seconds .
10,6,6,We are such weirdos right ?

1,5,6,Do you have any idea what time it is ?
2,1,6,My bad . I didn't realize that it was so late .
3,6,6,Do you really think that that excuses your tardiness ?
4,6,6,Of course not . I really did lose track of time .
5,6,6,Didn't I tell you to call when you're running late ?
6,6,6,Yeah  you did . I just forgot to call .
7,6,6,It doesn't matter  you should have called and let me know .
8,1,6,That's true . My bad for not calling .
9,5,6,If you do this again  don't even bother coming home .
10,3,6,You're going to kick me out over this ?
11,6,6,Exactly  maybe that'll teach you to respect my rules .
12,5,6,Well  if I'm not living here anymore  then I won't have to listen to your rules .

 (4, 3),(5, 4),(6, 3),(7, 3),(7, 6),
1,6,6,Excuse me .
2,6,6,Yes  Miss  what can I do for you ?
3,6,6,I ordered my dish about a half an hour ago  but it hasn't arrived yet .
4,1,6,I'm sorry for that  I'm going to check with the chef right now . Miss  I just checked with the kitchen  and they said your order will be coming right up next . Oh  here comes .
5,0,6,Thank you .
6,1,6,Miss  I'm very sorry for the delay  please enjoy this . Free a glass of wine for inconvenience . Again I'm terribly sorry to make you wait so long .
7,0,6,It doesn't matter .
5737 9
 (3, 3),(5, 5),(6, 3),(6, 5),(6, 6),
1,6,6,They must have got in through the kitchen window .
2,6,6,If only we'd remember to close it .
3,3,6,I am afraid your diamond bracelet has gone  darling !
4,6,6,I wish I'd put it in the bank .
5,3,6,Look ! they've taken your fur coat too .
6,1,6,I know  I am sorry I ever bought it .
7,6,6,I noticed they've taken our radio and left the television .
8,6,6,It's a pity they didn't take the tele . We need a new one . Anyway we can claim for all this from the insurance company .
9,6,6,I wish we could  but we can't  you see  we are not insured .

1,6,6,Hello  Ellen .
2,6,6,Hello  Helen  have you heard the news ? There ' s been a horrible accident .
3,1,6,Oh  no ! What happened ?
4,6,6,Hilda Harris husband  Henry had an accident on his way home from work .
5,1,6,How awful ! Was he hurt ?
6,6,6,Yes . He was taken to the hospital in an ambulance .
7,6,6,How did it happen ?
8,6,6,His car was hit by an express train . It happened at the crossing just behind his house .
9,1,6,How horrible !
10,6,6,He ' s having an operation in the hospital now . Poor Hilda ! You can imagine how unhappy she is .
11,6,6,I hope he ' ll be all right .
12,6,6,I hope so  too .

1,6,6,May I help you ?
2,6,6,Yes  I would like to return these slacks .
3,6,6,Alright . Do you have your receipt ?
4,6,6,Yes . Here it is . I bought them last week .
5,6,6,And why are you returning them ?
6,6,6,I bought them to go with a blouse of mine . But they don't really match .
7,1,6,I see . Oh  wait . Ma'am  I'm sorry . These slacks were on sale .
8,6,6,Yes  they were thirty percent off .
9,1,6,I'm sorry  but we don't allow returns on sale items .
10,6,6,I know many stores have that policy . But I have returned sale items here before .
11,1,6,I'm sorry  but we usually don't do it . It is our policy .
12,6,6,I just bought these slacks a week ago . And I am a regular customer here . Can you make an exception this time ?
13,6,6,Well . Let me talk to the manager for a moment . Madam  the manager says can do it this time .
14,0,6,Good . I'm a regular customer here . I am glad you can make an exception for me .
15,6,6,Please show me your receipt again .
16,6,6,Here it is .
17,6,6,I will have to give you store credit  Madam . If you can find something else you like in the store  you can use the credit .
18,6,6,Store credit is okay with me . I'm sure I will find something I like . I shop here a lot .

2,0,6,Yes  it is . Thanks . I ' m just surfing on the internet .
3,3,6,Here ? In this cafe ? How can you do that ?
4,6,6,This cafe offers a wireless internet connection . That means I can get on the net for free while I ' m here . Of course  I have to buy a cup of coffee !
5,0,6,That ' s great . Can you do it anywhere ?
6,6,6,No . you can only do it when the cafe offers a wireless connection . There are only about 10 or 12 places that offer it in this city .
7,6,6,So  what programs do you have on your laptop ?
8,6,6,I ' Ve got all the usual ones for word processing and then I have a few for creating and editing photographs .
9,6,6,I know you are keen on photography . It ' s very useful for you to be able to download photos from your digital camera . Then you attach the picture files to emails and send them to anyone  anywhere  at anytime !
10,0,6,It ' s wonderful  isn ' t it ? Would you like to see some photos that I look recently ?

 (2, 2),(3, 2),(4, 4),
1,6,6,Did you get your grades yet ?
2,1,6,Yeah . My whole GPA is screwed up now .
3,3,6,Why ? What happened ?
4,1,6,Well  I bombed my econ final and ended up with a 1 . 7 .
5,6,6,Ouch . You must be very disappointed .
6,6,6,Well  it's my fault because I didn't study as much as I should have .
7,6,6,Why don't you re-take the class next year ?
8,6,6,That's what I plan on doing unless I keep screwing up . How did you do this semester ?
9,6,6,I didn't do that well either . I ended up with a 3 . 2 this semester . That drops my total GPA to 3 . 45 .
10,6,6,My GPA is pretty similar to yours . I have a 3 . 1 now because of the stupid econ class .
11,6,6,What was your GPA before this semester ?
12,6,6,I was sitting happy with a 3 . 4 .
13,6,6,Why did it go down so much ?
14,6,6,Let's just say I screwed up more than my econ class .
15,6,6,What happened to you ?
16,6,6,I started playing starcraft and ended up wasting a lot of time .
17,6,6,You better stop slacking off .
18,6,6,You're right . I'm not going to play games during school anymore .

4,0,6,I'm keen on talking short trips to nearby scenic spots . More often than not  I go with some of my friends . By the way  what are your favorites ?
5,0,6,I love swimming and cycling . On Sunday morning I have swimming practice for an hour . In the afternoon  I just ride my bike around the city or along the country roads for almost two hours .
6,0,6,That's great ! I think they do you a lot of good . Where do you swim ?
7,6,6,Mostly in the city's swimming pool . But on occasion  I go to the beach with friends . Well  what do you do at leisure ?

4,6,6,How did you like the movie ?
5,0,6,I thought it was pretty good .
6,3,6,Really ? I can't say I agree .
7,3,6,You're kidding . The story and acting were outstanding .
8,6,6,I guess I expected too much from the movie  so I was a bit disappointed .
9,6,6,I guess it could happen .

4,0,6,It ' s a wonderful Spanish style .
5,0,6,Oh  I love the roof tiles on Spanish style houses .

4,6,6,He's very nice  actually  but rather eccentric .
5,3,6,Really ? I love eccentric people .
6,6,6,Yes  but he may be too eccentric even for you .
7,3,6,Why ? What do you mean by that ?
8,6,6,Well  haven't you heard ?
9,6,6,Heard what ? No one ever tells me anything .
10,6,6,Well  apparently  he's been having an affair with his secretary .
11,3,6,Really ! How fascinating .
12,6,6,According to Mary  he's divorcing his wife and there's a big fight going on about the children . I thought everyone knew .
13,6,6,Well  what can I say ? I didn't know . Oh  I meant to tell you earlier  your blouse doesn't really match your skirt . Those colors don't really suit you either .

4,0,6,Where is it ?
5,0,6,It is located at the east foot of Western Mountain of Beijing  in a park with the same name . There are some huge stones within the mountain which look like the censer  so it is called ' Fragrant Mountain ' .
6,0,6,Have you visited it before ?
7,0,6,Many times . Except climbing  there are many attractions worth visiting .
8,0,6,Like what ?
9,0,6,It is the best season to view red leaves from the Mid-October to the first ten days of November . During the period  thousands of hectares of maples on the sloping field are so red that you would recognize them as fallen petals by mistake if looking from a further area . The bright red  pink  scarlet  and peach-puff leaves are distributed in different layout  with some green pines and cypresses dotted in between .
10,0,6,Sounds marvelous .
11,0,6,You can take a bird-eye view at the glorious picture when you arrive at the top of the mountain .
12,0,6,Great . I will prepare some clothes and food for the climbing .

9,6,6,What do you mostly do during your workout ?
10,6,6,I concentrate mostly on my legs  chest  arms and stomach .
11,6,6,I should start exercising more .
12,6,6,It's hard work while exercising  but it is a great feeling when I get done .
13,6,6,I have a running machine at home . I used to use it  but I already got sick of it .
14,6,6,Exercising at home is hard . The environment is not suited for exercising .
15,6,6,If I want to exercise  I will need to join a gym .
16,0,6,I have a couple of guest passes . You want to check out my health club ?
17,0,6,That's a good idea . Let's go over the weekend .
18,0,6,Great . I'll call you Saturday morning .
19,0,6,Aright . I'll talk to you later .
20,0,6,Ok . Bye .

 (1, 1),(10, 10),(12, 11),(16, 15),(25, 25),(26, 26),
1,0,6,I'm glad we came here . This is really delicious !
2,6,6,I was worried you would think it was too far to drive .
3,6,6,Well  it's true I've never driven two hours just to get lunch . But really  I think it's worth it .
4,6,6,I think if you try some more authentic Chinese food  you might understand how we students from Taiwan suffer .
5,6,6,How do you mean " suffer " ?
6,6,6,I mean  in Milwaukee there is no good Chinese food . So we miss the food in Taiwan too much . Sometimes we just have to drive down here to Chicago to find something better .
7,6,6,Even in the winter ?
8,6,6,Yes  even in the winter .
9,6,6,And even if it takes two hours  huh ?
10,0,6,Why not ? I've been craving good food for three weeks now . I'm too sick of hamburgers and pizza !
11,6,6,Well  this really is delicious  I have to admit . I can understand better now why you and your friends are always whining .
12,0,6,Don't tease me ! Good food is really important to Chinese !
13,6,6,I know . I can see that . This is what is called " dim sum  " right ?
14,6,6,Yes  all these dishes are different " dim sum " dishes . You can't find this kind of thing except for in a few cities in America .
15,6,6,So when you Chinese think of Chinatown  you mostly think of food . Is that right ?
16,0,6,Of course . I will try to buy some things at the Asian grocery down the block too . Then I can do a little cooking in my apartment .
17,6,6,And maybe we can go to a good Italian restaurant for dinner  after the museum . Chicago has some great Italian restaurants .
18,6,6,No way !
19,6,6,What do you mean ?
20,6,6,We're going up to the " new " Chinatown for dinner . I already know where we're going to go .
21,6,6,Alright  alright . I am happy to try more Chinese food . Will it be dim sum again ?
22,6,6,No  dim sum is usually eaten around lunch time  or sometimes closer to breakfast . We ' ll try more Taiwanese style up at the " new " Chinatown .
23,6,6,Taiwanese style ? Isn't dim sum Taiwanese style ?
24,6,6,No  dim sum is more Cantonese style . But of course you can buy it in Taiwan .
25,0,6,I wonder if you can cook things this good .
26,0,6,I'm a great cook actually . You will see .

1,6,6,Well  how was your honeymoon ?
2,0,6,It was fantastic ! We had such a good time . The only problem was that because it was their high season  we spent hours queuing .
3,0,6,Peak periods always entail hours of queuing . At least you got a nice tan though !
4,0,6,Yes  Florida had great weather while we were there . You look tan  too . Did you go somewhere ?
5,0,6,My friends and I just got back from Bali .
6,0,6,Wow ! Bali Islands have some of the best beaches in the world  don't they ?
7,0,6,Yes  we were lucky . My friend's father owns a resort on one of the islands  so we were able to stay for free .
8,6,6,Did you go diving while you were there ?
9,6,6,I took a few diving classes  but I didn't really like it  so I did snorkeling instead !
10,6,6,Did you take any pictures in the ocean ?
11,0,6,I've got quite a few pictures of all different kinds of fish . I'll show them to you next time I see you .
12,0,6,Have you started planning your christmas vacation yet ?
13,0,6,We're planning on going skiing in Switzerland . Do you ski ?
14,0,6,No  but I do like snowboarding .
15,0,6,Would you like to go skiing with us for christmas ?
16,0,6,I'll talk to my husband about it ; I'm sure he'll say yes ! He loves Switzerland !
17,0,6,It is Europe's spotless land of lakes and mountains ! Let me know as soon as you can so we can get a discount .

 (2, 2),(4, 2),(4, 4),(6, 2),(6, 4),(6, 6),
1,6,6,What's up ? You look low .
2,1,6,It's my girlfriend . I guess she's playing the army game .
3,6,6,How come ?
4,1,6,I saw her dating with her ex-boyfriend again .
5,6,6,I understand that . But I think maybe it's not a date . You are taking the matter too much to heart .
6,1,6,Maybe . But it still gets on my nerves .

1,6,6,Hey  Daniel  how's it going ?
2,0,6,Hey  Daddy  today I had really a fantastic history class .
3,3,6,Wow  it's so strange for you to say things like that . What had happened ?
4,6,6,We've learnt the story of Zheg He Sailing to West Ocean . He is a real great navigator .
5,6,6,Did your teacher tell you the route he took ?
6,6,6,Yeah  he  with his fleet  came across the Indian Ocean  and arrived at the east coast of Africa .
7,6,6,Great  do you still remember when he started his voyage ?
8,6,6,Of course  that is from 1405 to 1433  which is in Ming dynasty .
9,6,6,Good  by the way  do you finish reading the book Robinson Crusoe I've bought for you ?
10,6,6,Not yet  you know I have a lot of homework to do .
11,6,6,You should speed up  because the story of Robinson can give you a better understanding about what you learned today .
12,0,6,OK  great Daddy  after supper  I'll embark on it .
13,0,6,That's my boy ! Wait  Daniel  when is Pirates of the Caribbean on ?
14,0,6,Is it about Captain Jack Sparrow  who wants to find the treasure on the sea ?
15,0,6,Exactly  now  tell me the time .
16,6,6,I won't tell you  unless you promise to let me watch it with you .

1,0,6,Hi  Monica  congratulations ! Your presentation at the meeting was very successful and everyone was impressed by your speech . And it was so persuasive and I bet our clients will be convinced to invest their money in this project . You really made a big contribution to our company .
2,0,6,Thank you  I just tried my best . I am very happy to know you like it .
3,0,6,You must have been prepared for a long time . Some statistics in this presentation are not easy to find  right ?
4,0,6,Well  yes . Several colleagues from different departments helped me with that . They are very supportive . I consulted an economic expert last week . He was very kind to give valuable suggestions .
5,0,6,Now  the effort pays off . You have accomplished something .
6,0,6,Come on  don ' t flatter me anymore . I took the job because I love being challenged . But I can ' t get this turned around without the support from you people .

 (1, 1),(2, 1),(2, 2),(3, 1),(3, 2),(3, 3),(4, 3),(4, 4),
1,0,6,There are so many flavors of ice cream to choose from !
2,0,6,Yes  there must be about a hundred . Do you have a favorite ?
3,0,6,I love fruit flavored ices the best .
4,0,6,I know  fresh fruit flavored is the best ever .
5,6,6,What is your least favorite ice cream ?
6,6,6,I don't like peppermint ice cream .
7,6,6,Yeah  I know what you mean .
8,6,6,One time  I tried garlic ice cream .
9,6,6,That could be interesting .
10,6,6,That doesn't sound like a good choice for today though . Let's order !

3,0,6,I really enjoyed the food .
4,6,6,What did you enjoy the most ?
5,6,6,I enjoyed the fish the most .
6,0,6,The fish was pretty special  but I loved the dessert .
7,0,6,The macadamia cake was out-of-this-world !
8,0,6,I really felt that the service was exceptionally good .
9,0,6,Yes  the service really added to the experience .
10,0,6,I am looking forward to returning to this restaurant .

1,6,6,Come on  you must tell me everything about him .
2,0,6,Well  he's very tall and handsome .
3,6,6,Hmm ...
4,0,6,He has big blue eyes and long blonde hair .
5,6,6,Oh  how long ?
6,0,6,Down to his shoulders . It's beautiful  like gold .
7,6,6,OK . OK . You'd better tell me what he does .
8,0,6,He's a very creative painter . His paintings sell well .
9,3,6,Really ?
10,0,6,He's quite a patient teacher  too .
11,6,6,Fine .
12,0,6,You're going to like him . Everybody says he's a nice guy .

 (1, 1),(3, 3),(7, 7),
1,1,6,I'm terrible sorry . I seem to have mislaid your MP4 .
2,6,6,Don't worry about that .
3,1,6,Very sorry that I have caused you so much trouble .
4,6,6,No trouble at all .
5,6,6,Won't you let me buy a new one tomorrow ?
6,6,6,No  that's quite out of the question .
7,1,6,Please accept my deep apology .
8,6,6,I never did like this MP4 anyway . I won't hear of it .
3474 10
 (1, 1),(2, 2),(9, 9),(10, 9),
1,0,6,Good afternoon  Sam .
2,0,6,Good afternoon  Tina .
3,6,6,What are you going to do tomorrow ?
4,6,6,I'm not sure yet . And you ?
5,6,6,I would like to go skating . Feel like going with me ?
6,6,6,Is skating interesting ?
7,6,6,I think so . Fresh air  white snow . It's so comfortable .
8,6,6,But I can't skate well .
9,0,6,It doesn't matter  I can teach you .
10,0,6,It's very kind of you .
7050 26
 (1, 1),(2, 1),(11, 10),(21, 20),(25, 24),(25, 25),(26, 25),
1,0,6,I really appreciate your driving me around .
2,0,6,It's no problem . I have time today  and I think it's important that you find a good place .
3,6,6,It would be hard for just me to do it . I don't know the city at all .
4,6,6,So what do you see in there ?
5,6,6,This one sounds good . Efficiency with view of the lake . Utilities and parking included . Newly remodeled kitchen . $ 470 .
6,6,6,Can you afford that much ?
7,6,6,No  I guess not . But that's what I want  isn't it ? An efficiency .
8,6,6,Yes  an efficiency is a small apartment . Usually one large room and a small bathroom . There is often a small kitchen too . So it's good for one person .
9,6,6,How about this one ? Downtown efficiency . Furnished ... What does furnished mean ?
10,6,6,That means the apartment has furniture in it .
11,0,6,That's good .
12,6,6,Sometimes it's good  sometimes it's bad . You have to like the furniture .
13,6,6,Furnished . Parking included . $ 400 .
14,6,6,It's still pretty expensive .
15,6,6,Yes  but it's downtown . I would like to take look at this one .
16,6,6,Alright . What's the phone number ?
17,6,6,256-7797 .
18,6,6,Got it . What else do you see ?
19,6,6,This one . Two male grad students seeking roommate . Must be quiet . Comfortable downtown apartment . Does this mean I have to share a room with them ?
20,6,6,No . It probably means they have a large apartment . Probably a living room  kitchen and three bedrooms . They need someone for the empty bedroom .
21,0,6,That sounds alright .
22,6,6,Yes  it might be an advantage for you . You are a foreigner  after all . If they're alright roommates  you could learn a lot from them .
23,6,6,Here's the number  256-4367 .
24,6,6,Got it . Let ' s call these two and see if we can make appointments to see the apartments .
25,0,6,Sounds good to me . I really appreciate your help on this .
26,0,6,Don't mention it  Larry . What are friends for anyway ?
2301 6
 (3, 3),(4, 3),(5, 3),(6, 3),
1,6,6,Hi  Lucy . What are you going to do this weekend ?
2,6,6,I have no idea yet . Do you have any suggestions ?
3,0,6,Would you like to play tennis with me ?
4,0,6,I'd like to .
5,0,6,Be sure to get to the sports hall at nine o'clock on Sunday morning .
6,0,6,OK  will do !

1,0,6,What a nice day !
2,0,6,Yes . How about going out and enjoying the sunshine on the grass ?
3,6,6,Great  let's go !
4,0,6,Hey  darling  I think I might have a little heatstroke from being in the sun all day . I was so relaxed . It felt as if I were in another world .
5,0,6,Exactly . You know  the sunshine and wind remind me of our honeymoon . You remember ? The island  the sound of the waves  the salty sea air and the sunshine ...
6,6,6,Yes  it was wonderful but it's already been a year . How time flies !
7,0,6,Why not go again to celebrate our one-year anniversary ? We can go to the same beach  stay in the same hotel and enjoy a dinner in the same restaurant .
8,6,6,Are you kidding ? Can you afford it ? Do you think we can get a room on such short voice ?
9,6,6,Never mind that  I'll take care of it . Are you available next week ?
10,6,6,Yeah  I think so .
11,0,6,Ok . I'll make the arrangements . It will be great .
12,0,6,Wonderful ! I'll start packing our suitcases .

 (1, 1),(2, 1),(3, 2),(3, 3),(4, 4),(5, 4),(5, 5),(6, 5),(7, 7),
1,0,6,I ' m going to the beauty parlor . Do you want to come too ?
2,0,6,Sure . Let ' s go . What are you going to have done ?
3,0,6,I want to have a foot massage and haircut .
4,0,6,A foot massage sounds like a great idea . They are very relaxing . I ' d also like to have a mudpack on my face . It ' s supposed to help with your complexion .
5,0,6,Good idea . We should also pedicures and manicures .
6,0,6,This could become a very expensive trip to be beauty parlour !
7,0,6,I think it ' s a good idea to pamper yourself occasionally . Don ' t you agree ?
8,6,6,Oh  I agree . We both work hard and a little beauty treatment can relieve stress .
9,6,6,Maybe we should try a thai massage too .
10,6,6,What ' s special about a thai massage ?
11,6,6,That ' s when the masseuse walk on your back and massage you with her feet .
12,6,6,Sounds painful !
6663 10
 (1, 1),(2, 1),(3, 2),(4, 3),(4, 4),
1,0,6,Kata ! You've got a beautiful singing voice . You hit the high notes perfectly .
2,0,6,Thank you for your compliment . But you are exaggerating . I think you are destined to be a singer . You have the best voice !
3,0,6,Thank you . Maybe we can sing a song together . Would you like to sing with me ?
4,0,6,Yes  I'd like to . It's my honor . Let's pick a song .
5,6,6,How about this one ?
6,6,6,Sorry  I can't sing the song .
7,6,6,Er ... How about this one ?
8,6,6,OK . But I'm not familiar . I don't know the beginning part .
9,6,6,Never mind . You can follow me . I'll sing the first part .
10,6,6,OK .
2826 16
 (2, 2),(4, 2),(6, 2),(6, 6),(14, 13),(16, 13),(16, 15),
1,6,6,Sarah . You look terrible . What's wrong ?
2,1,6,My grandmother just passed away .
3,6,6,I'm so sorry to hear that . When did this happen ?
4,1,6,A couple of days ago . I just go back from the funeral .
5,6,6,Is there anything I can do ?
6,1,6,No ... not really . The sad thing is that I wasn't there when she died . I really wanted to be there one last time .
7,6,6,I'm sure she knew you loved her . Did she pass away in the hospital ?
8,6,6,Yeah . She died in her sleep .
9,6,6,I'm sorry she's gone .
10,6,6,At least she didn't suffer .
11,6,6,I think your grandmother would want you to think of all the good times you spent together .
12,6,6,I know . But I miss her .
13,6,6,When my grandmother passed away  I frequently visited her in the cemetery . I always talked to her . Even though she wasn't there  I somehow knew she heard what I said .
14,0,6,Yeah ? That's what I was thinking too . Thanks .
15,6,6,It looks like you haven't eaten anything all day . We should get you something to eat .
16,0,6,You're right ... I should eat something . Let's go .

1,0,6,Do you like flowers ?
2,0,6,Of course  I like flowers .
3,0,6,What's your favorite flower ?
4,0,6,I like peach blossom  because I like spring .
5,0,6,Peach blossom is really beautiful .
6,0,6,Yes . How about you ?
7,0,6,I like lotus .
8,0,6,You have a perfect taste !
9,0,6,But there aren't any lotus now .
10,0,6,Yes . It's snowing outside . Let's enjoy the plum blossoms .
11,0,6,That's not bad . Let's go .
4233 12
 (1, 1),(2, 1),(3, 1),(3, 3),(4, 3),(4, 4),
1,0,6,It's going to strike 12 o'clock . Let's get the firecrackers ready  Rose .
2,3,6,Aren't firecrackers forbidden in the city ?
3,0,6,Well yes  but they are not allowed only in downtown areas . It's OK here . It would be difficult to ban customs that have thousands of years of tradition . The habit does bring kids joy and excitement so long as precautions are taken . Let's go out and set off firecrackers out there .
4,0,6,Fantastic ! The whole city is echoing with crackling sounds !
5,6,6,What other activities will you have tomorrow ?
6,6,6,Quite a lot . The celebration of the New Year has just started . The first day we southerners have sweet rice cakes for breakfast  and people in the North have Jiaozi . Afterward  we will make New Year calls on family relatives  husband's side on the first day and wife's side on the second .
7,6,6,Do you bring some gifts along ?
8,6,6,That's for sure . Fruit  cream cakes  medical tonics are often for parents and aged relatives  and cash enclosed in a red envelope for the kids . All this  of course  should be well prepared beforehand .
9,6,6,Is it the same practice for all families ?
10,6,6,Not all the same nowadays I must say . Many families  especially those of newly married couples  choose to make an overseas trip to escape the routines . Rose and I had a tour to Singapore  Malaysia  Thailand and Hong Kong last year . We stayed there for two weeks until the last day of the holiday .
11,6,6,I really appreciate the way you Chinese people exchange feelings . The holiday's long enough for you to relax .
12,6,6,Well  for city dwellers  the Spring Festival is a holiday of seven days . While in the country where traditions are still heavily emphasized  the festival lasts ten days .
2553 8
 (5, 4),(6, 5),(6, 6),(7, 6),(7, 7),(8, 7),
1,6,6,What a hot day !
2,6,6,Yes  summer is coming .
3,6,6,Where are you going this summer vacation ?
4,6,6,I'd like to go to Tianjin .
5,0,6,Do you want to go to the beach there ?
6,0,6,Yes  of course . And what's your plan ?
7,0,6,The same to you .
8,0,6,That's great .
2486 12
 (4, 3),(4, 4),(5, 4),(5, 5),(7, 7),
1,6,6,Do you take a bus to and from work ?
2,6,6,Yeah  everyday . And there ' s only one choice . All the other buses are going the other direction .
3,6,6,Hmm . I have the same problem . When I leave work  it ' s always rush hour . So the buses are always crowded .
4,2,6,Oh  yeah  it ' s terrible . I will tell you the funniest thing I have seen in China . It ' s when so many people try to get onto one city bus  and the last guy is squeezed in so tight that the door is tightly pressed against his butt .
5,2,6,That sounds terrible the way you describe it . But you know  not long ago I really suffered on the bus .
6,6,6,What happened ? Were you having a hard time getting on a bus ?
7,5,6,You just can ' t imagine ! I waited for the first bus but it was too full  so I waited for the second  and it was still very crowded . Then I decided not to wait for the next one  and got on the second bus . It was so full that I had to stand on one foot ! No kidding !
8,6,6,Hmm . Good exercise  uh ?
9,6,6,Yeah  absolutely !
10,6,6,And it ' s so much fun . One day  the bodies were so tightly packed that some girl ' s behind was pressed against my front . I was afraid to put my hands down for fear of accidentally groping her .
11,6,6,You were so happy  weren ' t you ?
12,6,6,What do you think ? I ' m a good boy .

1,0,6,Do you know how to go to the Fragrant Hills in Beijing ? I heard that they are very famous in China .
2,0,6,Yes . Especially in autumn  the red leaves of the maple trees make the whole mountain red .
3,0,6,That must be very beautiful .
4,0,6,Yes  it can make people feel as if they were in the land of fairies .
5,0,6,Really ? Have you ever been there ?
6,0,6,A couple of times .
7,0,6,Can you go there with me ? I'd like someone who is familiar with that area to go with me .
8,0,6,Sure . I'd be very glad to be your tour guide .

1,0,6,Your garden is looking very beautiful this summer . The flowers are really colorful .
2,0,6,Thank you . I have roses  tulips  and daffodils . Do you like the rockery with the smaller flowers ?
3,0,6,Yes  I do . Those are violets  aren ' t they ?
4,0,6,Yes  they are . This afternoon  I ' m going to prune the hedge .
5,0,6,The lower branches on that tree are hanging very low . Would you like me to cut them off for you ?
6,0,6,Thank you ! That would be very kind of you . I have a saw in the garden shed .
7,0,6,When the lower branches are removed  you ' ll be able to sit under the tree .
8,0,6,Tomorrow  I ' ll cut the grass . Then the garden will look perfect .
9,6,6,Just make sure children don ' t play in the flower beds and destroy the flowers .

1,0,6,There is a new restaurant opening up in town next month .
2,6,6,What kind of food will they be serving ?
3,0,6,My favorite  Mexican . And I've heard that the head chef is from San Paulo .
4,0,6,It sounds like this is going to be authentic Mexican food .
5,0,6,I can hardly wait !
6,6,6,Do you know the day they plan to open ?
7,6,6,I'll double check the announcement .
8,6,6,Maybe we can make reservations ahead of time ?

 (4, 4),(5, 4),(6, 4),(7, 4),(8, 4),
1,0,6,You are married to a foreigner  aren't you ? So what's it like ?
2,0,6,Well  in the first year of our marriage  we had great difficulties in getting along . The things that are important to me are not important to him . We had a lot of conflicts .
3,0,6,Yeah  I know what you mean . The first year of any marriage is difficult for all couples  not to mention two people from different cultures .
4,0,6,Now we have a two-year-old boy . We're very happy that he's healthy and smart .
5,0,6,Oh  so he's half Chinese and half American . That's unusual . What languages does he speak  then ?
6,0,6,Right now he speaks mostly English  and he can say a few Chinese words . But he will learn in the future .
7,0,6,What does he look like ? Can people tell ?
8,0,6,Yes  people surely can . He's whiter than the Chinese kids  and his hair is a little blonde . My husband says his eyes are very Chinese though .

1,0,6,What a great weekend that was !
2,0,6,My feelings exactly .
3,0,6,I really enjoy the beach in the summer .
4,0,6,I couldn't agree with you more .
5,0,6,We should come here more often .
6,0,6,You are absolutely right .
7,0,6,I'd like to come back next weekend .
8,0,6,That's exactly the way I feel .
2825 12
 (3, 3),(4, 3),(4, 4),(8, 7),(9, 8),
1,6,6,Okay  show me your card hand . Here's mine . I have three Kings and a pair of Aces .
2,6,6,How did you get that ? No need to show you my hand  I lose . This is not as much fun as the music concert we just saw .
3,0,6,Thanks again for buying the tickets . That was the most exciting live concert I've ever seen . That silver electric guitar was really cool .
4,0,6,They're quite popular now . Wasn't her voice good ?
5,6,6,That  My Heart Will Go On . It warms my heart . you know  JanetJackson  Shanna Twain and Celine Dion are so very different .
6,6,6,Janet Jackson is more pop music . Shania sings country music . Celine just seems to hit all the right notes .
7,6,6,Have you heard Maria Carey ?
8,0,6,Yes  l have two of her Cds  l'II lend them to you if you like .
9,0,6,Excellent . You can borrow my Janet Jackson's CD . It's her new one .
10,6,6,I hope you have a good stereo .
11,6,6,Why ?
12,6,6,Because you have to hear it really loud to get the full concert effect .

1,1,6,The time has come to say goodbye .
2,1,6,So soon . It seems as if you just got here .
3,1,6,I feel that way  too . But all good things must come to an end  as they say .
4,0,6,It certainly has been a pleasure seeing you again and renewing old memories .
5,0,6,I've had a great time and thank you for your spending so much time showing me around .
6,0,6,It was fun for me  too . It gave me a chance to get away from my routine .
7,0,6,You'll be out to see me next year  as you promised ?
8,0,6,Oh  yes . I should be there some time next spring .
9,0,6,I'll be expecting you then .

1,0,6,You must be pretty excited about your trip to Europe . When is it that you are leaving ?
2,0,6,In just three weeks  and I am excited . But there are still a few things I need to do before I go .
3,6,6,Like what ?
4,6,6,Like renewing my passport  going to the travel agency to buy my plane ticket and figuring out what to do with my apartment while I'm gone .
5,6,6,You are not going to give it up  are you ?
6,6,6,No way . I'll never find another apartment around here . But I don't like the idea of paying three months ' rent on an empty apartment  either .
7,6,6,I don't blame you . Perhaps you could sublet it .
8,6,6,Yes  but whom to ?
9,0,6,Mmm ... let me think . Oh  I know just a person . An old colleague of mine  Jim Thomas  is coming here to do some research this summer  from June to August .
10,0,6,That's exactly when I'll be away . It sounds ideal  as long as the landlord agrees .
11,0,6,Tell you what  I'll be calling Jim late this week anyway  so I'll mention it to him then .
12,0,6,Well  thanks  Bill . Let me know what happens . That extra money will really come in handy .

 (1, 1),(2, 1),(3, 1),(4, 1),(4, 3),(5, 1),(6, 1),(6, 3),(6, 5),
1,0,6,Lester  you are really fantastic at automobile repair .
2,0,6,Thanks  June . But I think I need to be certified as a mechanic before I ' m allowed to repair cars for a living .
3,0,6,That ' s not a big problem . There are many small schools for adults like you who can study to be certified .
4,0,6,I guess I never thought of that before .
5,0,6,And you can easily get a student loan from a vocational school  or from the government .
6,0,6,Wow  you ' Ve inspired me to do something !

1,6,6,Can I help you ?
2,6,6,Yes  I need to buy a computer for this semester . I was told it is cheaper to buy computers here .
3,0,6,Well  you heard right . You can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . We have great discounts for students .
4,6,6,I don't know much about computers . But I know I want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . And I need a printer .
5,6,6,Well  first let's consider your computer . Here  for example  is a system I highly recommend--the Power Macintosh G3 . It comes with 64 megabytes of total memory .
6,6,6,Is that a lot ? Sixty-four ?
7,6,6,Yes  it is . It should be enough for any student needs you might have . What department are you in ?
8,6,6,History .
9,6,6,Well  so you will mostly be using word processing  for writing papers . I recommend the Corel Word Perfect program for word processing . We can talk about software later . Let's talk about your
10,6,6,Thirty percent ?
11,6,6,Yes .
12,0,6,Wow . That's really good . And you think this is really a good system for a graduate student ?
13,0,6,Yes . It's an excellent system .
14,6,6,Hmm . Hey  wait . This has an Apple on it . Is this an Apple computer ?
15,6,6,Yes  it's a Macintosh . It's Apple . Macintosh and Apple are the same thing .
16,6,6,I don't want Macintosh . I want PC .
17,1,6,I'm sorry  but our university computer center only sells Macintosh equipment .
18,3,6,What ? Are you serious ?
19,6,6,Yes .
20,3,6,But nobody uses Macintosh !
21,6,6,That's not true . Most of the students and professors in the university here use Macintosh . They find it is better for writing and word-processing  and that is what students mostly do . Ma
22,6,6,Yes  I'm from Taiwan .
23,6,6,Well  I know that in most Asian countries Apple is not very popular . But here in America  especially in universities and publishing companies  Apple is very commonly used .
24,6,6,But I need a computer that can handle writing in Chinese .
25,6,6,There are several Chinese writing programs you can use with Macintosh . Chinese is no problem for Apple .
26,1,6,Hmm . I think I should ask some of my friends for advice before I make a decision . I'm sorry .
27,6,6,No  don't be sorry . It's reasonable to ask your friends . But believe me  most of the students here in the university--Asian students included--most of them use Apple .
28,0,6,Well  thanks for your advice . I will probably come back later .
29,0,6,You're very welcome . Here is my card  if you need any help .
3177 11
 (4, 4),(5, 4),(10, 9),(11, 10),

4,0,6,You speak English very well .
5,0,6,Thank you .
6,6,6,Do you know what time it is ?
7,6,6,Sure . It's 5:10 PM .
8,6,6,What did you say ?

4,6,6,There you go .
5,5,6,I don't think that you're done .
6,6,6,What's wrong ?
7,5,6,My hair looks hideous .
8,6,6,What's so bad about it ?
9,5,6,It doesn't look good at all .
10,6,6,Sorry about that .
11,5,6,I really hope that you didn't expect me to pay you for this .

2,3,6,Really ? How do you get the chance ?

4,0,6,Congratulations . How lucky you are !
5,0,6,Thank you . I ' m leaving tomorrow morning .
6,0,6,I ' m sure you ' ll enjoy the trip . China is such a beautiful country .

2,5,6,Wow ! Why so much ? I thought they were getting you an assistant .
3,5,6,They were supposed to  but so far nobody ' s turned up  and I ' m left on my own to do the work . This is the first break I ' Ve had all day .
4,5,6,They ' re really running you into the ground . Why don ' t you ask for some time off ? You could take a long weekend and go away somewhere .

2,0,6,Yeah  why not ? We haven't been out for dinner for quite a long time . A new French restaurant has just opened in our neighborhood . We can go there .
3,0,6,Do we need to book a table in advance ?
4,0,6,No need for that . It's not usually busy on weekdays .
5,0,6,What time shall we go ?
6,0,6,Why not now ? I'm hungry .

4,6,6,May I have a look at your costume ?
5,6,6,Sure . Wait a moment . ( Several minutes later ) Here you are .
6,0,6,I like your black clothes and your fangs are cool .

2,6,6,Hi Steve . This is Mike . What are you doing ?
3,6,6,Oh  hi . I was just watching TV .
4,6,6,There's nothing to watch right now .
5,6,6,I know . I was watching a re-run . I have nothing to do and I was bored .
6,0,6,Me too . Let's get together and do something .
7,0,6,I'd like to  but I have to meet my parents in an hour for dinner . How about tomorrow ?
8,0,6,Yeah . Let's plan something tomorrow .
9,6,6,Did you hear the weather forecast for tomorrow ?
10,0,6,I think it is going to be the same as today . Clear and sunny .
11,0,6,That's great . We can do something outdoors then .
12,6,6,Are there any special events going on tomorrow ?
13,6,6,Yeah . I think there's a live outdoor concert by the river tomorrow .
14,6,6,Oh yeah . I heard about that too . Let's go check it out .
15,6,6,Do you know what time it starts ?
16,6,6,It starts at one PM .
17,0,6,Let's meet for lunch at eleven thirty and afterwards  we can head over there .
18,0,6,Perfect . I'll see you in front of the apartment at eleven thirty .

1,6,6,There are lots of new teachers in our class this semester .
2,6,6,Yeah  so what do you think about the teachers ?
3,6,6,To be honest  I like all of them  except for the math teacher . Though he must be quite young  he seems like an old person . He's so boring .
4,6,6,I think so too . I don't like him either . Well  who do you like best ?
5,6,6,It might be the English teacher . What about you ?
6,6,6,Me  too . She speaks very clearly and doesn't use very complicated words so that it is easy for us to understand her .
7,0,6,She is a pretty good teacher ! With her help I think I can make great progress in English .
8,0,6,Yeah  I like her way of teaching . She told us not to cram for exams  and to pay more attention to communicating than memorizing .
9,0,6,I think it's a good way to develop our language ability .
10,0,6,Actually  our new math teacher is a good person . He just can't find an appropriate way to teach us .

6,0,6,I see . And I'll always be devoted to you .
7,0,6,Thank you . I know I've nothing to offer you  but I'll never give you reason to cry .
8,0,6,I'll never hurt you ; I'll never lie .
9,0,6,My love will grow  like a river to flow .

3,0,6,Thank you .
4,6,6,This is our courtyard .
5,6,6,It's so spacious  about 40 square metres  right ?
6,6,6,Yes  about 46 square metres .
7,6,6,Are these corn ears hanging on the tree branch ?
8,6,6,Yes .
9,0,6,Very beautiful and very interesting . But why do you hang them in the tree ?
10,6,6,They don't have enough time to peel it after they harvested them  so they hung them in the tree . Then in winter  they can peel corn ears in their leisure time .
11,0,6,Very good idea . Sometimes such pictures can show the house's richness .

1,0,6,How is night life in Beijing ?
2,0,6,Very interesting !
3,0,6,What do you suggest then ?
4,0,6,How about going to dance ? There is a very good nightclub nearby .
5,0,6,That's a great idea . Let's go ... Oh  the dance hall looks very nice and the music is wonderful .
6,0,6,I'm glad you like it . The band is called " Four and One " . They are especially good at playing rock and roll .
7,0,6,That's great ! I love to dance to fast music .
8,0,6,Then you must be interested in disco dancing  aren't you ?
9,0,6,Yes  disco dancing is my favorite . It ' s great fun and good exercise as well .
10,0,6,OK . Let's disco .
11,0,6,Now the band is playing a slow dance .
12,0,6,That's a waltz . Would you like to try it ?
13,6,6,Sorry  I think I'Il sit out the next dance .
14,6,6,All right . Let me get you something to drink .

1,6,6,May I come in ?
2,6,6,Come in  please .
3,6,6,I'm sorry to trouble you  but I'd like to ask when I will get a raise .
4,6,6,In 3 months or so .
5,6,6,You said the same thing three months ago .
6,3,6,Did I ? Well  anyway  you will get your raise when the economy starts picking up .
7,6,6,You mean that I won't get a raise until the recession ends ?
8,6,6,Yes .
9,5,6,I got the message . I'm quiting .
10,6,6,Nah  don't be so fast . We like your work here  but this company is on hard times . and I can't be handing out raises for anyone .
11,5,6,I've been here for 3 years  and I haven't had a raise in all that time . If you like my work  it should be reflected in my pay  and I feel it isn't .
12,6,6,I hear what you're saying  and I wish there were something I could do .
13,5,6,Very well  consider me gone .
4792 12
 (4, 3),(7, 6),(7, 7),(9, 8),(11, 9),(11, 10),
1,6,6,I'm so hungry . Shall we go eat now  Rick ?
2,6,6,sure . Where do you want to go ? Are you in the mood for anything in particular ?
3,6,6,how about some dumplings ? I just can't get enough of them .
4,3,6,dumplings again ? ! Oh  Amy  let's try something new !
5,6,6,well  what do you have in mind ?
6,6,6,how about the Mongolian hot pot ?
7,3,6,oh  it's too spicy for me . Don't you remember last time when I tasted the lamb ? It was so spicy my eyes teared up !
8,6,6,maybe we can try Yuanyang pot this time . You can choose the non-spicy soup base .
9,0,6,sounds great . Do they serve noodles ? I am in the mood for some tasty noodles as well .
10,6,6,yes . The sliced noodles they offer are among the most authentic Shanti cuisines .
11,0,6,great . Let's go !

1,6,6,Why didn't you text me last night ?
2,3,6,What ? I sent you three or four messages !
3,6,6,I didn't get any of them . I was waiting for you to text me the address of where the party was and I never got your message .
4,5,6,Why didn't you just call ? I hate sending SMS messages .
5,6,6,Well  because I didn't have any credit on my phone . I used it all up this month .
6,3,6,I thought you had an unlimited SMS plan ?
7,6,6,I do  but if I don't have any credit in my phone  it won't let me call or send messages .
8,6,6,No wonder you didn't get my texts !

3,0,6,Well  that dress certainly shows your good taste . It must have cost a lot .
4,6,6,No  not much . I got it on sale at the mall - 60 % off .
5,3,6,Really ? You're an amazing bargain hunter ! Next time there's a sale  promise you'll let me tag along with you .
6,6,6,It's a promise .

 (1, 1),(2, 1),(3, 1),(3, 3),
1,5,6,Oh  my God ! I've been cheated !
2,3,6,What ? What did you buy ?
3,5,6,It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it !
4,6,6,What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ?
5,6,6,There was a guy on the sidewalk . He had three new boxes  Panasonic video camera boxes . He said he had to get rid of them quick .
6,6,6,And ?
7,6,6,So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks .
8,6,6,And it's a brick ?
9,6,6,Yes .
10,6,6,I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ?
11,6,6,I wanted to . But he said  no  the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store . If it's opened  other people won't believe it's new .
12,6,6,So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic .
13,6,6,Yes  it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products . Look  it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new .
14,6,6,But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ?
15,6,6,He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen .
16,6,6,Aha ! Now I understand . You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk . So  what I think is  you deserve to get cheated !
17,6,6,C'mon  don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it . We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box .
18,6,6,That's no problem . He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy . And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from . Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there . Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around . So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you . Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks .
19,6,6,You're right  Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ?

4,0,6,I was there for about three weeks .
5,3,6,That's a long time ! Was the weather OK ?
6,0,6,Yes  most of the time . But it snowed a lot in Chicago .
7,0,6,So  what was the best thing about your trip ?
8,0,6,Oh  that's difficult to say . But I guess I liked Nashville the best .

2,0,6,Nope ! It's the latest generation of PAD ! You won't believe what it can do .
3,6,6,For instance ?
4,6,6,It has a built-in camera unit that takes digital color stills . It also plays MP3 files  which I can save on media cards and then transfer to the hard drive of my computer .
5,3,6,Wow ! Anything else ?
6,0,6,This one comes with its own folding keyboard . It has a pre-installed handwriting recognition program . I can use the stylus to write on the screen .

7,6,6,OK  you go back to our car and fetch the picnic stuff .
8,3,6,Oh  so heavy ! What have you put in here ?
9,6,6,Nothing special . Food  drinks  and Daniel's kangaroo toys .
10,3,6,Toys ? Why do we need toys for a picnic ?
11,6,6,He said he would like to be our tour director and he lined up many things to do .
12,6,6,Sure  then . May it really be a day of enjoyment . Other than that  we can also teach him something about science .
13,3,6,Science ? What are you talking about ? Forget about your science  OK ? It's a picnic !
14,6,6,I mean we can inspire him for a deeper understanding of the natural world .
15,6,6,I can't agree on that . Just cut it out . Give him a break and don't spoil the day .
16,6,6,Well  OK . you are always right .

2,0,6,Yes . Swimming is one of my most favorite sports  indoors or out-doors .
3,0,6,Me too . Swimming is a very good exercise for health . It combines water  bath  sunbath  and air bath together . It promotes the growth and haleness of muscles  bone  viscera and nerve systems .
4,0,6,I have never thought that swimming can bring us so many benefits . I only know that swimming in great waves and deep running water can train people's spirits  and enable people to be fearless of the hardships  dangers and difficulties and become brave and staunch .
5,0,6,Have you ever swum in a river or a lake ?
6,0,6,Yes  but not always . However  I won't let it go if I have a chance .

3,6,6,Well  to tell the truth  I don't really feel like it tonight . I had a pretty hard day and I'm sort of tired .
4,6,6,Hmm . Well  in that case  we could go to the movies .
5,6,6,Oh  we always go to the movies . Can ' t we do something different ?
6,6,6,Well  do you have any suggestions ?
7,0,6,Let's see . How do you feel about playing bridge ?
8,0,6,It's OK with me  but we don't have any beer and things .
9,0,6,Well  shall I call Janet and ask her and Tom to come over  and I'll go to the store and buy some stuff .

3,6,6,I'm with you on that . Check out that one over there . I think I'm in love !
4,6,6,well  she's alright  but not really my cup of tea . What about the blond with the red dress ?
5,6,6,oh  that's Janice . She's just new in town . You have a thing for blonds  eh ?
6,6,6,yeah ! She could do anything she wants to me !
7,6,6,I bet . Why not go over and talk to her ? She's really nice .
8,6,6,I don't think so . I get so nervous talking to girls . I always put my foot in my mouth  scare her off  and end up looking like a real fool . Besides  she is way out of my league .
9,6,6,come on ! Man up ! You'll never know until you try .
10,6,6,okay okay  just let me have another cup of beers to get my head in the game .
11,6,6,all right . But I think you ought to move soon .
12,6,6,why ?
13,6,6,I can see five other guys eying her up .

3,6,6,What about a factory tour ?
4,6,6,You mean visit a factory ?
5,0,6,Yes . I heard there's a lager motor company nearby which is open to the public every weekend . We can go to see how a car is manufactured and learn more about the automobile industry .
6,0,6,Good idea ! I've always been interested in that . How much is the entrance fee ?
7,0,6,I'm not sure  but as far as I know  most factory tours are free . They are sponsored by the company providing the tour .
8,3,6,Really ? What do the companies do that for ?
9,0,6,I believe most of them think it as good public relations . They can promote their product and make their company better-known .
10,0,6,Oh  ISEE . So factory tours are good for companies as well as visitors .
11,0,6,Exactly .

12,6,6,Maybe . But if there's a blackout  probably the pubs are closed . And besides  I know you have a political science exam tomorrow . I thought you had a lot of reading to do .
13,5,6,Yes  that's true . Damn ! I just lost half my paper  and now I can't even do my homework . This is a bad time for this to happen .

12,6,6,They're smoking pot . Don't worry about it .
13,3,6,Pot ? Isn't that marijuana ?
14,6,6,Yes  it is .
15,3,6,But  Sharon  that's illegal ! The police could come  and we could go to jail .
16,6,6,Don't worry about it . It is true that pot is illegal in America . But the laws aren't as strict as in Taiwan . If people are arrested  and they have a little pot in their possession  they don't go to jail . They just have to pay a fine .
17,3,6,Really ?
18,6,6,Yes .
19,6,6,I didn't know you had such wild friends . Do you smoke marijuana too ?
20,6,6,I tried it a couple times . But I don't like it . I like alcohol better . Don ' t worry about them  though . If you don't want to smoke pot  you don't have to .
21,6,6,I don't want to .
22,6,6,That's alright . But you really should have another drink . People will probably start dancing soon .
23,6,6,I don't know if I can drink more . I already had two drinks .
24,6,6,You had two drinks at nine o'clock . C'mon  Ann  you are in an American university now ! You have to learn how to drink .
25,6,6,I thought a university was for studying .
26,6,6,It is . We study hard all week . And then  on the weekend  we party hard . That's the best way to live .
27,6,6,Alright . I'll have another drink .

1,6,6,Good morning . I ' m from the new york book review . Could I ask you some question about your latest book ?
2,6,6,Sure . Take a seat ... what would you like to know ?
3,6,6,First  I ' Ve heard that your latest book is based on a true story .
4,6,6,That ' s correct . It ' s a murder mystery based on actual murders that book place in florida several years ago . The main character-the police invesigator-is based on the man who investigated the case .
5,6,6,How do you research your books ?
6,6,6,I always visit the places that I use as setting for stories . Readers like things to be as factually correct as possible-even in fiction ! I usually base my characters on people I have met . Most charact

2,6,6,Oh  Mike . How are you doing ?
3,6,6,Not bad . It seems you are super yogurt lover . You have so many in your cart .
4,6,6,Well  I prefer yogurt to all the other drinks . Have you ever tried a kind of yogurt with old milk in it ? It tastes great and very healthy too .
5,6,6,Oh  I haven ' t noticed that before . Maybe I will try next time .
6,0,6,Why don ' t you go ahead of me ? I have more items than you .
7,0,6,Thank you . In fact  I am in a hurry . My wife is waiting for me at the parking lot .

2,0,6,It's very nice  I like it very much .
3,0,6,May I invite you for the first dance ?
4,0,6,My pleasure . But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer .
5,0,6,In fact  I took up dancing quite recently  too .
6,0,6,Oh  really ? But you're doing the tango wonderfully well .
7,0,6,I'm glad you say so  you dance beautifully too . It's lucky that I got a partner .
8,0,6,Thank you for your compliments . It's just that you are a good leader . Do you like the samba and waltz ?
9,0,6,Yes . And what dances do you like best ?
10,0,6,Waltz is my favorite . I like it better than any other dances .
11,0,6,Oh  the music has stopped . Thank you for the dance .
12,0,6,My pleasure . Let's go and have a drink .

2,6,6,I am reading .
3,6,6,I can see that . But why are you reading advertisements for houses for sale ? Are you buying a house ?
4,6,6,No  not yet . But I like to see what is available .
5,0,6,Can I have a look as well ?
6,0,6,Of course  have a seat .
7,0,6,Oh  this one looks really good . And look at the garden . So beautiful .
8,0,6,Yes  nice . But I prefer this wooden house with a garden fence and a sloping roof .
9,0,6,Yes  but my house has large windows and so gets lots of sun . And it has a small balcony at the top .
10,0,6,Well  you can't compare a small balcony to this large veranda . This is perfect for having a barbecue in summer .
11,0,6,Talking about a barbecue  didn't you say you are organizing one next week ?
12,0,6,Yes  next Saturday . I hope you can make it .

2,2,6,I'm sick of it  too .
3,2,6,The door bell doesn't work  there's no hot water  and the building is falling apart .
4,6,6,It's no use complaining . If we had got enough money  we couldn't put up with it  and would have moved out .

4,6,6,How do you do ? I'm Ted Nugent .
5,6,6,Sorry  what was your last name again ?

7,6,6,Ok  I'm Tom .
8,0,6,Glad to meet you .
9,6,6,And what do you do  Ted ?
10,6,6,Me ? I'm in the car business .
11,6,6,Salesman ?
12,6,6,Yes  that's right . And how about you ?

1,0,6,Wow  there are so many lanterns to appreciate . Now  I can see why it's called the Lantern Festival . It deserves its name .
2,0,6,Yeah . People always enjoy the lighted lanterns and the gala performances .
3,6,6,What are they doing over there ? People keep on gathering there .
4,6,6,Did you notice the characters on the lanterns ?
5,6,6,Sure . But you know that I can't read any Chinese characters . What do they say ?
6,6,6,They are puzzles . It's a tradition to solve the puzzles on the lanterns during the Lantern Festival .
7,0,6,Very interesting . But I'm afraid we'd better do something else . Hey  look ! There is a huge lantern there . Let's get close to it .
8,6,6,It's really eye-catching . It's the biggest dragon lantern I've ever seen in all my life .
9,3,6,Really ? Then I'm really lucky . Oh  it's spewing fireworks from its huge mouth .
10,0,6,Very impressive . It's made of glass which makes it even brighter .
11,6,6,There are many Chinese characters on its body  too . What are they about ? Puzzles ?
12,0,6,Let me have a look . Oh  no . They are Chinese poems which describe this happy scene .

6,6,6,Don't worry . It's safe .
7,4,6,But I've never jumped off anything in my life . The highest thing I've jumped off is my bed . I'm scared .
8,6,6,You are the one who wanted to come here  Sandy . You should enjoy it .

1,0,6,Hey Lucas  how was your trip to Paris ?
2,0,6,It was wonderful  but I was so tired .
3,0,6,Did you go to the top of the Eiffel Tower .
4,0,6,Yes  that was the first thing we did . We went all the way to the top . There were visitorsfrom all over the world taking photos there .
5,0,6,What else did you see ?
6,0,6,Art galleries  cathedrals  statues  fountains  palaces  bistros  there's really too much to say .
7,0,6,You must have had a great time .
8,0,6,Yes  at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . However  on the third day of travelling in the city  I felt sick I think I had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening .
9,0,6,Yes . you need to be careful with what you eat when you're abroad . sometimes new food might disagree with you .
10,0,6,On the fourth day  we went to taste the French cuisine . That was really fantastic . And no stomach problems .
11,0,6,That is great . Everyone says French food is wonderful .
12,0,6,You'll have to try for yourself some day .

1,0,6,I love Chinese food .
2,6,6,What's your favorite dish or dishes ?
3,6,6,Well  I always order fried spring rolls when I go to Chinatown .
4,6,6,But a Chinese person would never order that .
5,3,6,Really ? But they're delicious !
6,6,6,Alex  you don't know what to order . Let's go to a Chinese restaurant together next time .
7,0,6,That sounds great .

3,0,6,This is a great botanical garden in the city .
4,0,6,Listen to the sound of nature ! It's like music .
5,0,6,Yeah  I agree . It makes you feel really good .
6,6,6,What are those . Miss Liu ?
7,6,6,Do you mean the red flowers ? They are peony flowers ?
8,6,6,The red and yellow peony flowers are so beautiful .
9,6,6,Yes  you like them very much . right ?

1,6,6,Have you seen this ?
2,6,6,What ?
3,2,6,They killed another hostage .
4,2,6,Oh  how awful . What a terrible thing to do .
5,2,6,I agree completely . I just don't understand what's wrong with them . Don't they have any humanity ?
6,6,6,Well  maybe they've got a point . I mean  I suspect that they think the same about us .
7,6,6,Yes  but that doesn't make them right  does it ? Just because they think so ?
8,6,6,I guess not . My view is that we should give in to their demands  so that innocent people can stop getting killed .
9,6,6,Come on  you can't be serious ! We should never give in to terrorist's demands  otherwise where would we be ?
10,6,6,Well  that's probably true  but I don't think we should be dogmatic about it . A colleague of mine was kidnapped once  so perhaps I have a different view of things .
11,3,6,Really ? What happened ?
12,6,6,Well  it was in the Balkans during the war . He was only held for three days  and then they simply released him . It was a case of mistaken identity  and they just let him go when they found out he was no use to them . It was lucky they didn't kill him .
13,6,6,Oh  sure .

3,6,6,There's an action movie with Harrison Ford and a chick flick with Susan Abandon .
4,0,6,I've never seen a movie I don't like that had Harrison Ford in it .
5,0,6,So  is that a yes ?
6,0,6,Yes . What time does it start and do you want to meet me there ?
7,6,6,It starts at one and yea  let's meet there . It's the cinema on the corner of Lincoln and Main .

4,6,6,Do you have clubs ?
5,6,6,No . Can I rent clubs ?
6,6,6,There are clubs for beginners . It's cheaper to buy those rather than rent them a few times .
7,6,6,What kinds of clubs ?
8,6,6,Like the seven-piece set . It's only $ 120 .
9,0,6,I'll buy a set . But you have to teach me .

2,0,6,I love this store . The only problem is that it ' s extremely expensive .
3,0,6,don ' t worry . I ' Ve decided that for your birthday I ' m going to take you shopping for a new dress .

5,0,6,I do  that ' s why you should appreciate this gift !
6,0,6,sure . That ' s really nice of you . Let ' s go in and try some things on .

8,0,6,that ' s gorgeous ! Do they have it in a size 8 ?
9,0,6,here you go . On any other day  it would cost me a fortune  but it ' s on special offer today .

4,0,6,Me either . From the very first page  this author just pulled me right in !
5,0,6,Can I read it when you're finished ?
6,0,6,Yes . I'm in the last chapter now and it is just gripping .
7,6,6,Don't tell me anything about it . I want to read it for myself .

1,0,6,Hey  Shirley . The party has been wonderful . My husband and my children have enjoyed it very much  and me too .
2,0,6,I've said you will enjoy your life here !
3,0,6,I surely will . By the way  is the party like this held every weekend in our neighborhood ?
4,0,6,Oh  I've forgotten to tell you . The party is held every other week . And every family gives their own performance each time .
5,0,6,My children would like that ; they like dancing very much .
6,0,6,That's good !
7,3,6,Look ! Who is that guy on the stage ?
8,3,6,Oh  my God ! That's my husband  Benjamin .
9,3,6,Really ?
10,3,6,He likes American Idol very much  and he always imitates the contestant at home . I can't believe he got on the stage himself .
11,0,6,He performs very well . He is so funny !
12,0,6,OK  just ignore him . I've noticed there are lots of exercise facilities in our community . After dinner you can go there for a walk with your family !
13,0,6,OK  that's perfect ! By the way  is there any playground in our neighborhood ?
14,0,6,Yes  there is one behind our building . And you can play tennis there . But if you want to play tennis there  they will change you 30 Yuan per hour .
15,0,6,OK  got it ! Thank you so much . You have helped me a lot !
16,0,6,You are welcome ! We are neighbors !

1,0,6,It ' s so relaxing  taking a walk in the country . The air is so fresh and clean .
2,6,6,would you like to live in the country ? I ' m not sure I ' d like it .
3,6,6,I can see a lot of advantage and disadvantage . The problem is that  for me  each advantage has its own disadvantage .
4,6,6,What do you mean ?
5,2,6,Well  I hate the noise in the city  but I love being around lost of people . The problem is that you can ' t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . The two just don ' t go together .
6,6,6,I see what you mean . I love being far away from a city  but I hate being so far away department stores and sports facilities .
7,6,6,People can ' t have it both ways . If you live in the country  it is often less convenient . If you live in a city  it is noisy  but there ' s more to do .
8,0,6,I would love to be surrounded by hills and streams . They ' re so much better to look at than concrete  rows of parked cars and tall buildings .
9,0,6,I would love to hear the birds singing and feel the fresh breeze on my face . When the wind blows in the city  you get dust in your mouth and in your eyes .
10,0,6,The view from the hill is so beautiful and relaxing . There ' s so sign of pollution . The village looks so peaceful .
11,6,6,Just remember that in that village there ' s nothing to do . There ' s not even a pub or restaurant . There ' s just one small shop with a poor selection of goods .
12,2,6,You ' re right . I would have to travel to the city at least once a week to go shopping and see friends . I would hate living in the country !

1,6,6,it's getting cold .
2,0,6,yes . I bought a scarf yesterday . It's really nice and warm . Have a look .
3,0,6,Oh  it's made of wool . I like the striped pattern .
4,0,6,yes  I adore simple fashions . How does it look on me ?
5,0,6,it looks great  but you need something to go with it . It's too plain on its own .
6,0,6,how about this blue sweater ?
7,0,6,that's a good idea . When did you buy it ? Is it a name brand ?
8,0,6,yes  but I bought it when it was on sale  50 % off the original price . OK  what do you think ?
9,0,6,that looks lovely . Just one more thing---you need a pair of earrings .
10,0,6,I've got a pair of pearl earrings . Here it is .
11,0,6,perfect !
12,0,6,you have good fashion sense  Karen .
13,0,6,thanks . We should be ourselves . There are so many fashion victims out there .
14,0,6,yes  but with our sense we'll always look good .

2,0,6,Thanks  Miss . Wang .

1,0,6,Here's some dancing . See those guys stomping  clapping and shouting ? They're practicing step-dancing .
2,0,6,It sounds cool . The rhythms look really difficult .
3,0,6,They basically turn their bodies into drums . There's a national step competition every year .
4,0,6,Well  black people are supposed to be great dancers .
5,0,6,Wen ! That's only a stereotype . Like all Asians are supposed to be math geniuses . I'm not a great dancer  and you said you failed calculus .
6,0,6,Ha-ha ! You got me there !

2,5,6,Didn't I tell you ? It's over !
3,6,6,Oh  I am sorry to hear that . I did't know that you had split up . What happened ?
4,5,6,It was a few things . The first thing that happened was that we were supposed to go out for a romantic dinner for our one year anniversary  but she stood me up !
5,3,6,Really ! Did she tell you why she didn't show up ?
6,5,6,No  but I ended up finding out later that night when I saw her drinking with another man at a club near my home !
7,6,6,What was she thinking ? Did you confront her about it when you saw her ?
8,5,6,I wanted to  but I knew that if I spoke to her  I'd just blow up at her  so I decided to just go home . I called her later that the night  but she didn't answer the phone .
9,6,6,I can't believe she would do that to you . It's so dishonest-and rude !
10,5,6,I know . I still haven't heard from her . The good thing is that I'm so angry with her that I don't feel sad about not having her around .
11,6,6,I bet you that she regrets what she's done . You are such a good catch ! She really lost out  didn't she ?
12,6,6,I guess so .
13,6,6,So I don't think you'll have a problem finding another girlfriend . There are plenty of fish in the sea !

2,0,6,Yeah . It is incredible ! Is it the work of Qi Bakshi ?
3,0,6,Yes  it is . How do you know that ?
4,6,6,Well  Qi is famous all over the world  isn ' t he ? Besides I am quite interested in Chinese painting .
5,0,6,Cool ! What kind of Chinese painting do you prefer  free sketch or claborate-style painting ?
6,6,6,I prefer free sketch  especially the landscape paintings . I can always feel peace and harmony from those landscape paintings .
7,6,6,That's true . Chinese art stresses the harmony between man and nature  which is an important part of China's traditional culture .
8,0,6,I love this art exhibition !
9,0,6,So do I . Let ' s go to other areas to see what they have got  shall we ?

2,0,6,Yeah  and most excitingly  I met the girl living under me today . She's really nice .
3,6,6,Is she American ?
4,0,6,Yeah  and most importantly  she's single ! Man  I could tell from the moment I saw her  she's the girl of my dreams !
5,6,6,So I take it you two are hitting it off ? I know it's very convenient to be in a relationship with your neighbor  but what if you break up ?
6,6,6,I don't know . I am not really worried about that . I don't wanna lose before even starting . Besides I think the other two American guys have also fallen for her .
7,6,6,Sounds like you've got some competition . You made a move already ?
8,6,6,Not yet . But I am thinking of inviting her to dinner sometime . I know some good restaurants nearby .
9,6,6,That's nice . Having been here a little while surely gives you the advantage  eh ?
10,0,6,You bet . Now that you mentioned it  I think I'll call her now and see if she is available tonight .
11,0,6,Good luck !

3,6,6,Well  Rose 
4,6,6,Is there something you need ?
5,6,6,Are your free this weekend ?
6,6,6,Yes  I have nothing to do .
7,0,6,Great  Is it convenient if i visit you this weekend ?

1,0,6,wow  it that your sports car ?
2,0,6,yes  do you like it ?
3,0,6,I love it ! I used to always want to drive a green jaguar . Is it in good condition ?
4,6,6,it looks good on the outside  but the inside is a different story . It needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again .
5,6,6,what's wrong with it ?
6,6,6,well  first of all  it needs a new engine  which is extremely expensive .
7,6,6,when's the last time you had it serviced ?
8,6,6,it must have been a few years ago now .
9,6,6,I thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis .
10,6,6,they do . Once my son was born  there was no reason to drive this car anymore . It's only a two-seater  you know !
11,6,6,what else is wrong with it ?
12,6,6,the heating controls don't work anymore  so it always feels like it's about 100 degrees in the car -- even in the summer !
13,6,6,anything else ?
14,6,6,the brakes don't really work that well anymore either .
15,6,6,why don't you get it all fixed ?
16,6,6,it costs more than you think to run a car  especially when there are so many things wrong with it !
17,0,6,well  let me know when you can get it fixed . I ' d love to go for a ride in it !

4,6,6,Can we adjust the pitch a little ? Maybe he'll sound better in a higher key .

4,1,6,I don't know . She always said I didn't love her  but I did .
5,6,6,Did you think about talking to her again ? Maybe she is waiting for your call .

4,6,6,Yes  that sounds wonderful .
5,6,6,OK . See you then .
6,6,6,But wait  wait  will there be food that is not meat ? You know . I'm a vegetarian
7,3,6,Hey ! I didn't know that ! When did you become a vegetarian ?
8,6,6,The other day  I decided that I needed to loose more weight so I am going to try to be a vegetarian . And you know what ? I don't miss the taste of meat .
9,3,6,Relly ? That's amazing .
10,6,6,Yes  it really is . After having vegetarian diet . I have much more energy  I need less sleep  I feel calmer . I can maintain an ideal body weight without worrying about how much I eat and I can think more clearly .
11,3,6,Are you kidding ? I really don't think that you think less clearly on non-vegetarian diet .
12,6,6,Yes  maybe . But I feel better since becoming a vegetarian . Maybe you could also have a try .
13,6,6,Maybe I'll also have a try some day  but I'm afraid that it would be difficult for me to refuse meat .
14,6,6,Maybe you would change your mind after having a vegetarian diet .
15,0,6,We'll see . Anyway  I'll prepare some vegetarian food for the barbecue . See you then !

4,5,6,Hey  I worked hard on that report and I deserve the grade I got .
5,6,6,It just happened to be the highest grade in the class .
6,5,6,You're just jealous because you didn't do as well as you thought you did . Admit it .
7,6,6,I worked hard too . But she always gives me a lower grade .

6,5,6,Well  they should have called you !
7,1,6,They said that they did . I've been so busy ...
8,5,6,And you didn't think to leave them my cell phone ?
9,6,6,I didn't think there would be a problem .
10,5,6,It's the holidays ! Everybody knows how hard it is to get tickets !
11,1,6,I'm sorry . We're still going . I got reservations for all of us on the 31st . It will be OK . Trust me .
12,5,6,Trust you ! You can't even handle simple plane reservations !
13,6,6,Brooke !

1,0,6,What a good day !
2,0,6,Yes . It's really wonderful here The grass is greener and the air is fresher than those in the city .
3,0,6,Right . Let's go out and enjoy the beautiful natural scenery .
4,0,6,Great  let's go .
5,0,6,Wow  what a beautiful lake ! The green hills and clear water really provide magnificent scenery .
6,0,6,En  it's so beautiful that I don't want to move my eyes from it .
7,0,6,I feel as if I'm living in a different world  honey .
8,0,6,The same to me . All the things here make me happy  the mountain  the water  the grass  the birds  the sunshine ...
9,0,6,I think we should go out more frequently . The natural scenery can do us good .
10,0,6,That's the point . We should walk into the nature and enjoy its beauty whenever we have time .
11,0,6,Right . The city life has made us tired and out of energy  while the natural world can bring us quite new feelings .

1,6,6,Could you tell me what university you want to go to  John ?
2,3,6,Pardon ?
3,6,6,What university would you enter ?
4,3,6,University ? Why ? You asked me last year .
5,6,6,Oh  I forget . Sorry .
6,6,6,I went to Harvard University .
7,6,6,Did you ? And what course did you take there ?
8,3,6,God save me ! Is there anything wrong with you ? Didn't I tell you ?
9,6,6,I've not known . Perhaps  I've got a bad memory .
10,6,6,I did a B . A . in economics . Remember ?
11,0,6,Terrific ! B . A .  again and again-B . A .

1,0,6,London is such a historical city ! There ' s history everywhere you look . There ' s nelson ' s column  built as a monument to one of the Britain ' s great admirals and his important victory . He won the battle of Trafalgar in 1805 .
2,0,6,I ' m looking forward to seeing Westminster abbey  where many historical figures are buried  like Isaac Newton  the great mathematician and Winston Churchill  the great wartime leader .
3,0,6,Nearby  on the banks of the thames  there ' s the statue of Boadicea . She fought the Romans when they invaded Britain .
4,0,6,Women have often played an important role in British history . Queen Elizabeth I built a navy strong enough to fight off the Spanish armada in 1588 . more recently  Margaret thatcher transformed british society in the 1980 ' s .
5,0,6,She was a very controversial leader . Are we going to visit the famous tower of London later ?
6,0,6,There ' s a lot to see there . Perhaps we should go tomorrow .
7,0,6,I ' m looking forward to seeing the famous castle and prison . Many historic figures were imprisoned there in the past . I really want to see the crown jewels too .
8,0,6,I ' Ve seen them before . They ' re quite incredible . If you want to see historical figures in London  there ' s one place you have to go .
9,0,6,Where ' s that ? Oh  I know ! Madame Tussaud ' s the waxworks museum .
10,0,6,There you can see british leaders  entertainers  criminals  and royalty .
11,0,6,Sometimes  it ' s hard to know who belongs in each section of the museum !

2,0,6,Not bad . We have had a big meeting today  remember ?
3,6,6,Oh  yea . I forgot . So how did it go ?

1,6,6,Lucy  you ' re back . How was your first day of school ?
2,0,6,It was great . I had a really good time .
3,6,6,What classes did you have ?
4,6,6,Well  I had English from 9 o'clock to 11 o'clock  art from 12 o'clock to 2 o'clock  and math from 2 o'clock to 4 o'clock .
5,6,6,What do you think about the teachers ?
6,6,6,To be honest  I liked all of them  except for the math teacher . Though he must be quite young  he seem like an old person . He ' s so boring !
7,6,6,That ' s too bad . How was your English teacher ?
8,6,6,She was great . In today ' s class  she gave us a lecture on how to be a good student . She told us not to arm for exams  and to pay more attention on communicating than memorizing .
9,6,6,Where is she from ?
10,6,6,She said that she ' s from a small town in the middle of America .
11,6,6,Were you able to understand everything that she said ?
12,6,6,Not everything  but nearly . She speaks very clearly and doesn ' t use very complex words so that it is easy for us to understand her .
13,6,6,She sounds like a good teacher . Do you think you ' ll pass her class ?
14,0,6,Yes ... with flying colors !
15,6,6,What does that mean ?
16,0,6,It ' s a new phrase that she taught us today . It means that I will not only pass the class  but I will do extremely well !
17,6,6,If you like the class this much already  I ' m sure you will .
18,6,6,I hope so .
19,6,6,did she give you any homework ?
20,0,6,not today . She said she wanted us to relax tonight instead of doing homework 
21,0,6,no wonder you like the class so much .

2,6,6,did you get the position you wanted ?
3,0,6,yes  I'll be promoted to department manager .
4,0,6,I'm glad to hear that . Congratulations !
5,6,6,thank you . Actually  I could not believe it at first . You know  there're so many outstanding people in our company . Many of them are qualified to fill that position .
6,0,6,sure  but you really did great and outperformed the others . You deserved it !
7,0,6,thank you very much .
8,0,6,you always have unique ideas and you're such a team leader .
9,0,6,I appreciate it very much . You've been doing great . I expect to see you be promoted pretty soon .
10,6,6,that's very nice of you to say so . I'll try my best . When will you start at the new position ?
11,6,6,next week .
12,6,6,so by then  you'll be in charge of the whole department .
13,6,6,absolutely .

1,6,6,Terrible . How about people's lives ?
2,0,6,Fortunately  there is no person died .
3,0,6,That's great . It seems that Typhoon is not as bad as earthquake .
4,6,6,Yeah . Earthquake is one of the most badly natural disasters in the world .
5,6,6,That's why many people died in the earthquake .
6,6,6,Well  China is located on the Eurasia plate  where earthquakes happen frequently due to the earth's plates knocking against each other .
7,6,6,Oh  China does have been plagued by numerous destructive earthquakes during its long history .
8,6,6,Yeah  we've experienced the 8 . 0 magnitude earthquake in Wenchman .
9,6,6,We're all familiar with natural disasters . but we still feel weak when we face Wenchman earthquake .
10,0,6,Right . But people at that time only know two words  " save " and " assistance "  they will never don't lift a finger . Life is the most important compared with anything else .
11,6,6,That's the point . Love among human beings is not limited by geography .

3,6,6,Mary said that she was really pleased with the photography .
4,2,6,I found it very disappointing .
5,6,6,She liked the acting  too  because that's what she wanted to see .

2,0,6,I'm moblogging !
3,3,6,Moblogging ? what does that mean ?
4,0,6,Oh  moblogging is a combination of the word ' mobile ' and ' blogging ' . It's another form of blogging . Users can publish blog entries to the web from a mobile phone or other mobile devices .
5,0,6,Sounds interesting ! That must be very convenient .
6,0,6,Yes  you're right . I can blog wherever and whenever I'm on the move . It's especially good when I'm on a business trip and my laptop happens to be away from me .
7,6,6,How can you do that ?
8,6,6,Well  if I simply want to write a few words  I'll send it by email or edit it all from the cell phone browser .
9,6,6,What if you want to publish some photos ?
10,6,6,Then I'll shoot some pictures  re-size the images and upload them with text descriptions to my blog .
11,0,6,I see . Moblogging must have done a great favor for habitual bloggers like you .
12,0,6,You bet it !

1,6,6,so  how should we go to the theatre ?
2,6,6,let's take the bus .
3,2,6,I hate the bus system in London ! The bus drivers are rude  the buses are never on time  and there are few people around who can help you .
4,6,6,it's not that bad . You probably just had a bad experience once .
5,6,6,it wasn't just once . Every single time I take the bus  something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus .
6,6,6,we could take the subway  but we'd have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice .
7,6,6,train fares are twice as expensive as the bus fare  too .
8,6,6,if we don't hurry up  we'll miss the show . Should we take the bus ?
9,6,6,we're already late  so I think we had better take a taxi .
10,6,6,I don't think we'll be able to find a taxi very easily during hush hours . Let's just take the bus .
11,6,6,fine . Have a look at the timetable to find out when the next one arrives .
12,6,6,it looks like it should be here in just a few minutes .
13,0,6,don't worry . Nothing bad will happen . I'll even buy your ticket for you .
14,0,6,thanks  that was nice of you .
15,0,6,see  now something good has happened to you on a bus trip !

1,0,6,Aren ' t you interested in watching the Olympics ? There have been some excellent performances by athletes from all over the world .
2,6,6,I just don ' t find it very interesting .
3,0,6,I think it ' s wonderful to see people from all over the world taking part in such a great event .
4,6,6,I think that for a lot of people  it ' s just a way to try and show their country is better than other countries .
5,0,6,I think the Olympics help to promote world peace .
6,6,6,I ' m not sure about that . We still have many wars in the world . I think that the idea behind the Olympics is a good one  but the reality is that during the Olympics countries compete . There ' s no real spirit of cooperation and people are usually not very friendly to each other .
7,6,6,You are so pessimistic ! The Olympics is a great opportunity for athletes to demonstrate their speed  skill  agility and strength . Most people hope to see someone from their country win  but I think that they are just happy to see good performances by any athlete .
8,0,6,Well . I think that the most amazing performances are by athletes who participate in the Paralympics .
9,0,6,Now there we are in agreement !

4,6,6,Yes . I've been to New York . I got back only yesterday .
5,6,6,Did you enjoy yourself ?
6,0,6,Very much . New York is such a nice place . Shall I show you some photographs ?
7,0,6,Thanks  I like looking at photographs . How nice ! Oh  I'm afraid I must be going now . I've got an appointment . Have a good day .

5,6,6,Would you like to play some tennis with me before going home ?
6,6,6,I'm not good at sports  I have never played tennis  and I know I would be terrible .
7,6,6,You should try it . It ' s a great game . Come on  let me help you . I'm a good player  and a good teacher  too . What do you say ?
8,6,6,OK  but don't say I didn't warn you .
9,0,6,That was a pretty good shot  Mary .
10,0,6,Thanks . This is fun !
11,6,6,Let me help you with your serve .
12,6,6,No one has ever tried to show me how to play a sport before . Maybe I should learn to do something .
13,6,6,Of course  you can . All you need is a little help and a lot of practice .
14,6,6,Do you really think I can be a good player ?
15,0,6,Well  maybe not a Michael Zhang  but better than the average . Person would you like to play again Wednesday ?
16,0,6,Yes . This has been fun .

4,0,6,Mary's father is a rich man  isn't he ?
5,0,6,You are right  Mary's father is responsible for the entire wedding-arrangement  costs  etc . I think he must spend much money .
6,0,6,Will Mary and her husband be ready to leave for their honeymoon ?

1,6,6,... Now that we have been over the gory details of our disastrous first quarter  Ed ! Give us some good news . How are things looking for us in terms sales this month ?
2,6,6,Uh well ... would you like the bad news first or the really bad news ?
3,3,6,What ? Ed  don ' t tell me you only have bad news !
4,6,6,Well sir  our sales have dropped  no plunged  fifty percent in the past month alone . We are currently overstocked and overstaffed and our profits refalling fast . The market is in recession and we have no way of moving our inventory  or getting rid of our staff . If we consider redundancies  it would cost us a fortune because of the new regulations governing compensation packages . It ' s a real mess .
5,5,6,For crying out loud ... How fast are we losing money ?
6,6,6,Um ... how can I put this ? Let ' s just say that at this pace  we will be filing for Chapter eleven in less than three months .
7,3,6,What ! Geez ! How could this have happened ? So what ' s the bad news ?
8,6,6,Oh  that ' s the really bad news . Our supplier suffered QC problems and  well  half of our production is faulty . We ' re going to have to recall all itemssold in the last quarter . And the worst part ? We ' re going to have to shoulder this cost .
9,3,6,Are you joking ? Get the supplier on the line now ! They have to assume the costs of this mess !
10,6,6,We tried that  sir . The factory has gone under and the owner apparently has fled the country .
11,5,6,We ' re doomed !
12,6,6,There is some really good news though !
13,3,6,Really ? What !

2,6,6,Nothing really  why  what ' s up ?

4,0,6,Sounds great  i ' d very much like having something thanks  when ?
5,0,6,Around six pm .
6,0,6,Do you need help setting up or anything ? I don't mind . I like to do that kind of thing . It's fun and I have a good eye for decorating .

1,1,6,I don't know what I'm going to do . I need to find a job . If I don't  I won't be able to stay here next semester .
2,6,6,Have you tried university part-time jobs ?
3,6,6,What do you mean ?
4,6,6,I mean in the library  or in some information center . Often the university hires foreign students for part-time positions .
5,6,6,Yes  I know . I tried that . They don't have anything now . So what can I do ?
6,6,6,Well  since you're a foreign student  it's hard . That ' s because it's actually illegal for you to work in America .
7,1,6,I know that . You don't have to tell me that . That's my problem . I know I have the right to work for the university . That's legal . But they don't have a job for me . And it's illegal for me to get a job elsewhere .
8,6,6,Anyway  there must be some solution . You know there are many people working illegally in New York .
9,6,6,But I need a pretty decent job . I need to make enough to pay my rent at least .
10,6,6,I have an idea .
11,6,6,What ?
12,6,6,Since you're Chinese  maybe you can find part-time work in Chinatown .
13,1,6,I already had that idea .
14,6,6,Well  why don't you go and look down there ?
15,6,6,But I don't know what I would do .
16,6,6,It may be part-time work as a waitress or something . It would be illegal  but sometimes waitresses make a good salary .
17,6,6,Maybe . I don't know .
18,6,6,I will ask my friends for you . Maybe someone knows a company that needs part-time people . That ' s another thing you should do . Ask all your friends to ask around for you . You might find something .
19,1,6,I have to find something . Otherwise I have to go back to Taiwan . I'll be broke in two months .

2,6,6,Oh  this ? I got it in Singapore . Here  do you want to take a look ?
3,0,6,Thanks . Gee  it's really light !
4,0,6,Yes  it is  isn't it ? A bit too light  really . What make have you got ?
5,6,6,I've got an old Ericsson . Here . Take a look .
6,0,6,Wow  that's really old .
7,0,6,Yes  I like collecting antiques .
8,6,6,Why don't you get a new one ?
9,6,6,I don't know . I like this one  and I don't have any need for all the bells and whistles you get on the new ones .
10,3,6,Really  what makes you say that ?
11,6,6,Well  I just need to make and receive calls  and it's quite reliable . I find that the more fancy stuff they put into these things  the more likely they are to break bown or go wrong  you know ? I mean  this camera function  for instance-how often do you use it ?
12,6,6,Sometimes  but I guess not very often . It's more for fun . Sometimes when I'm on a trip  for example  I can take a picture and send it to my kids . Or I can send a picture of a sample back to my office and get it costed up immediately .
13,0,6,Well  that's nice I guess . So how many kids do you have ?
14,0,6,Three . Two boys and a girl .

1,6,6,Have you been ever been to Disneyworld ?
2,6,6,When I was young  my parents took me to the one in California . I always forget which -- is that one Disneyland or Disneyworld ?
3,6,6,The one in Florida is Disneyworld and the one in California is Disneyland  so you must have been to Disneyland .
4,6,6,That's right . Why do you ask ?
5,0,6,Well  I've never been to either so I was thinking of going to Disneyworld for my honeymoon .
6,0,6,When are getting married ?
7,0,6,Some time next year . We haven't set the date yet .
8,0,6,Congratulations ! I had no idea .
9,0,6,Thank you . So what do you think ? Would we have a good time ?
10,6,6,Do you like amusement parks ?
11,6,6,For the most part  yes . Some of the rides are bit too scary for me  though .
12,0,6,If you don't think twice about the rides and go on every ride that you can  you'll have a good time .
13,0,6,Even the roller coasters that go through tunnels in the dark ?
14,0,6,Even those . It'll be very romantic  I think . You'll have loads of fun .
15,0,6,Thanks for the advice . I'll talk to my fiance about it tonight .

5,6,6,Oh  what a pity !
6,1,6,I just don ' t want to play table tennis any more .
7,6,6,Is it that bad ? It ' s nothing more than a game .
8,1,6,My opponent bowled me with the very first ball . I was wondering if it's appropriate for me to play table tennis .
9,0,6,Oh  come on ! Failure is the mother of success . Don ' t lose heart . I'm sure you'll succeed .
10,0,6,Perhaps you are right . But I still need some time to recover from the failure .

 (2, 2),(6, 6),(8, 8),
1,6,6,What's wrong ?
2,5,6,I have a headache . These past few days I've been living off painkillers . Man  I feel like my head is going to explode .
3,6,6,You should get acupuncture treatment . My mom was always having headache issues and it was acupuncture that cured her .
4,6,6,The results are too slow . On top of that  just the thought of smoking needles poking into my flesh frightens me .
5,6,6,They don't just randomly stick you  they find your pressure points . The heat allows the body to immediately respond to the treatment  restoring the body's " chi " .
6,4,6,But I get scared the moment I see a needle . How could I stand having needles in my body for hours on end ?
7,6,6,The needles are very thin  and as long as the doctor's technique is good  and the patient himself is relaxed  it won't hurt-on the contrary it will actually alleviate pain . Now there are high-tech needles that are micro thin ; they don't hurt at all . However  if you are really scared of acupuncture  scraping or cupping are also options .
8,4,6,Scraping is too terrifying . When they finish scrapping  your body is all red  as if you were just tortured . Cupping is the same  your body ends up with red circles all over . It looks like someone beat you up .
9,6,6,This only signifies that the toxins have left the body . Actually  there is only discomfort during the treatment process . Once it's over you feel very comfortable .
10,6,6,Chinese medicine is strange . The patients are already ill  and then the doctor makes them suffer more .
11,6,6,This is the only way to get at the problem . Anyway  if you want to relieve the pain  you are just going to have to be tough and do it .
12,6,6,Forget it . I don't want to inflict any more pain on myself . In a little while I'll go and buy some more painkillers and take a nap .

2,0,6,I'd be glad to tell you what I think .
3,0,6,Good ! I'm interested in your advice .
4,6,6,If I were you  I would change the beginning . You should write about your education first because we like to judge a man by his abilities .
5,0,6,Good idea  Betty . What would you think about the second part ?
6,6,6,I think it's too short . You'd better say something about your work experience .
7,6,6,You're right  I'll change it . How about the last part ?
8,0,6,Very good . But you should talk about your family  too .

5,0,6,No  not at all . It looks really classy on you . Where did you pick that up ?
6,6,6,I got it on sale down at the department store .
7,6,6,When did you go there ?
8,6,6,I was just there a couple of days ago . You know  you should go down there too . They have a lot of stylish clothes on sale .
9,6,6,I might just do that . What style of clothes do they have ?
10,6,6,Anything you want . They have both casual and formal styles .

2,0,6,Well  as you know I was in Thailand last month  and I took a cooking class ! So I prepared some of my favorite dishes .
3,0,6,Great idea ! As long as I don't get food poisoning ! So what is on the menu tonight ?
4,0,6,Ok  for starters we have Tom Yam soup . It's a bit spicy  but really good !
5,0,6,This is delicious ! The ginger and lemongrass really gives it a nice taste !
6,0,6,Now this next dish is one of the most famous . Foreigners call it papaya salad but the proper name is Tom Sam . It is a spicy salad made from a mix of fresh vegetables including shredded unripened papaya and tomato .
7,0,6,This is delicious ! The combination of sour and spicy is really interesting ! I could have this everyday !
8,0,6,Ok  now for the last and best dish in my opinion . This is called Pad Thai . It's stir-fried noodles with eggs  fish sauce  tamarind juice  red chili pepper plus bean sprouts  shrimp and tofu and garnished with crushed peanuts and coriander . It's practically Thailand's national dish !
9,0,6,Wow  this is great ! I never knew Thai food was so creative and delicious !

1,6,6,Who was the best teacher that you ever had ?
2,6,6,That would have to be Miss Baymler  my fourth grade teacher .
3,6,6,What was she like ?
4,0,6,She was patient  kind  fun  smart  caring  and yet strict  too . I really learned a lot from her .
5,6,6,What kind of things did you learn ?
6,0,6,She taught us that you can do anything that you want to do .
7,3,6,Anything ? Do you really believe that we can do anything ?
8,6,6,If you really want to do something and you work hard at it  I believe you can do it .
9,6,6,You said she was strict . Did she have a lot of rules ?
10,6,6,She had some rules that helped us to feel comfortable . For example  the students had to treat each other with respect  or they would be disciplined .
11,6,6,I see . She sounds like she really cared about her students .
12,6,6,Yes . She treated us all fairly . She don ' t have any teacher ' s pets .
13,3,6,Really ? Doesn ' t every teacher have a teacher ' s pet ?
14,6,6,Well . To be honest  I usually sucked up to teachers because I wanted them to give me good grades . However  Miss Baymler didn ' t treat me any differently . She really didn ' t have any teacher ' s pets .
15,6,6,Do you know what she is doing now ?
16,6,6,As a matter of fact  I do . After she taught our class  she got married and moved to another city . Then  she started writing children ' s book .
17,6,6,Have you ever read one of the books ?
18,0,6,Of course ! Both children and adults enjoy her books .
19,6,6,Why don ' t you recommend one to me ?

3,6,6,I slept like a baby . I fell asleep right away last night  didn't wake up once  and didn't have any nightmares !
4,6,6,That's great news ! You look much more relaxed than you did yesterday .
5,6,6,I feel much better  but I'm still worried about something .
6,6,6,What's that ?
7,6,6,Well  I have to drive to school for a meeting this morning  and I'm going to end up getting stuck in rush-hour traffic .
8,6,6,That's annoying  but nothing to worry about .
9,6,6,For me  traffic jams are quite stressful  because I'm pretty impatient . How can I prevent myself from getting stressed if I get stuck in a traffic jam ?
10,6,6,Just breathe deeply when you feel yourself getting upset .
11,0,6,Ok  I'll try that .
12,6,6,Is there anything else bothering you ?
13,6,6,Just one more thing . A school called me this morning to see if I could teach a few classes this weekend and I don't know what to do .
14,6,6,Do you have any other plans this weekend ?
15,6,6,I'm supposed to work on a paper that'd due on Monday .
16,6,6,Try not to take on more than you can handle .

9,0,6,You certainly do like teasing me  Mary . Well I'm in love with someone . The question is  how do I get his attention ?
10,0,6,Well  that's easy . Walk up to him and kiss him .
11,0,6,I guess I asked the wrong person .

1,6,6,School has added several new courses to our grade this semester . I have more homework to do now .
2,6,6,What's your favorite course  Daniel ?
3,6,6,I like science most .
4,3,6,Science ? That's a surprise .
5,3,6,Surprise ?
6,6,6,I thought you would like PE .
7,6,6,I do like PE  but I am interested in science .
8,3,6,Are you interested in science ? I can't believe it .
9,6,6,Through this course  I can learn more about the world around us clearly .
10,6,6,Your parents would be happy if they knew that . Because you are always a naughty boy .
11,3,6,Naughty ? I'm naughty ? I'm just clever . So I only do the things I am interested in .
12,6,6,Hope so .

1,6,6,I believe that you called me ?
2,0,6,Oh  hi . Thanks for getting back to me quickly .
3,6,6,Why did you call me ?
4,6,6,I was calling about your son .
5,6,6,Did he do something wrong ?
6,6,6,Your son was acting up in class .
7,3,6,What do you mean ?
8,6,6,He was talking and causing a disturbance during class .
9,6,6,That's really not like him .
10,6,6,If you could just talk to him  I would greatly appreciate it .
11,1,6,I apologize  and I'll make sure he doesn't do that again .
12,0,6,Don't worry about it  but thank you very much .

1,3,6,I can ' t believe my English teacher is making me read pride and prejudice !
2,6,6,Why not ! It ' s a classic . In fact  it ' s one of my favorite novels .
3,6,6,But it ' s so old .
4,6,6,Don ' t judge a book by its cover . Do you know what it ' s about ?
5,6,6,No  not at all .
6,6,6,First of all  it ' s a romance novel  set in the early 19th century .
7,6,6,I didn ' t realize it was a romance novel . What ' s the main storyline ?
8,6,6,It ' s basically about a father who tried to marry off one of his five girls .
9,6,6,Why does he want to do that ?
10,6,6,Since he doesn ' t have a son  he hopes that one of the girls will marry a wealthy man . That way  all of his daughters will be cared for .
11,6,6,Won ' t they get his inheritance ?
12,6,6,No  that ' s the problem . Though they are well-off  once he dies  his house will go to his cousin . So  when he dies  the girls will have nothing .
13,0,6,I see . This sounds interesting ! Maybe my teacher isn ' t so horrible after all .
14,6,6,So  are you going to read the novel or watch the movie ?
15,3,6,There ' s movie ? My teacher didn ' t tell me that !
16,6,6,That ' s probably because she wants you to read the book first .
17,6,6,It would take a lot less time ...
18,6,6,How about this . When you finish the book . I ' ll get the movie and watch it with you .
19,0,6,Ok . That sounds like a deal .

2,0,6,Almost . I have to get dressed . It's a formal party and I have special party make up !
3,0,6,Use this lipstick and it will make your lips shine !
4,0,6,Great ! Uh  remember that there's a gift exchange  too . We all have to bring a gift .
5,0,6,I've already got mine .
6,0,6,( At the Party ) It's Christmas Eve ! Time to open presents !

1,5,6,Stephanie ! Did you just get to school ? But you were up and about when I left the dorm this morning ! That was about an hour and a half ago . This happens all the time ! Why do you always take so long to get ready the morning ?
2,6,6,It ' s a skill . What can I say ? I don ' t know why  I just have a long routine .
3,5,6,Please explain because it makes no sense to me . How can a girl ' s routine be so complicated ? You get up  you shower  you get dressed  you brush your teeth  you ' re out the door . Half an hour  tops .
4,5,6,Jacob  you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling . I don ' t . I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings . Every day  I wake up and head straight for the shower . Every second day  I wash my hair . If it ' s a hair-washing day  I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily . Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too . Because my hair is so long  I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes . Afterwards  I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew . I take a long time to get dressed in the morning . Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before  but usually I do it in the morning . In all  getting dressed takes about half an hour  at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair . From time to time I ' ll put my hair up  but oftentimes I bloody it straight . And then  because of the texture of my hair  I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing . That ' s another twenty minutes or so . After that  I have my daily makeup routine .
5,6,6,True  I hardly ever see you without your hair done and your makeup on  even when you show up to class in sweatpants . Tell me  how long does it take you to choose that outfit in the morning ?
6,6,6,Not funny .

3,1,6,I don't know . I failed my exam .
4,6,6,What did you get ?
5,6,6,A B plus .
6,6,6,That's not bad .
7,3,6,But I should have aced it . I mean I finished the paper so quickly  thinking it's a piece of cake . But when I knew my result  I was like what ? That can't be true !
8,6,6,Listen  John . I understand that you are such an excellent student and I know you must have lots of stress  but you really want to give up ?
9,1,6,No  I don't . I just don't know how to handle this . This is my first time  you know .
10,6,6,I know . Don't worry . Do you know what you should do ?
11,6,6,What ?
12,6,6,You need to blow off some steam . The world is not on your shoulder .
13,6,6,How ?
14,6,6,Forget about school and exams . Come over to my house and have fun . I have some really good DVDs .
15,6,6,Thanks . But I really don't feel like watching movies tonight . I have to get an early start in the morning .
16,6,6,Then go to bed and have a good sleep .
17,0,6,I guess that's what I need . Thanks . You're being a really good friend .

2,0,6,I'd be glad to tell you what I think .
3,0,6,Good ! I'm interested in your advice .
4,6,6,If I were you  I would change the beginning . You should write about your education first because we like to judge a man by his abilities .
5,0,6,Good idea  Betty . What would you think about the second part ?
6,6,6,I think it's too short . You'd better say something about your work experience .
7,6,6,You're right  I'll change it . How about the last part ?
8,0,6,Very good . But you should talk about your family  too .
9,0,6,I agree . I appreciate your helping me .

4,5,6,You told Martha that I was on a date ? What was that all about ?
5,6,6,No ... that's not what I meant . I didn't mean that . She asked me where you were and I jokingly said that you were on a date with Sara . I thought Martha knew that you and Sara were just friends .
6,6,6,She started feeling suspicious after you said that .
7,1,6,I'm sorry man . I didn't know . I didn't mean to screw anything up .
8,6,6,Martha gets jealous easily and it took a while to convince her that Sara was just a friend . Now  I have to explain to Sara that I can't hang around her because of you .
9,6,6,Look . I really didn't mean to  and next time I see Martha  I'll really tell her that you and Sara are really just friends .

5,6,6,Come on  Han Maimed  don ' t make a fuss . A lot of Americans  including many scientists  believe in religion .
6,6,6,But I ' m really surprised . I thought science and religion are not compatible  are they ?
7,6,6,Yes  they are compatible . Actually  the U . S . is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world .
8,6,6,I've heard about it a little bit before  but I don ' t understand . How can people believe in God since they know God doesn't exist ?
9,6,6,That ' s a little complicated . You ' ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U . S . history later on . Religion was and is a part of American people ' s life . Guess what ? Even Harvard University  which is a highly academic institution  is in a sense the product of religion .
10,3,6,Really ?
11,6,6,Absolutely ! It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England .
12,6,6,Why was it founded by the Puritans ? Where were the atheistic educators ?
13,6,6,Because most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans .
14,3,6,How come ? I mean why most of them were religious people ?
15,6,6,That ' s because in the 16th and 17th century  there was a series of religious reforms in England . Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries .
16,6,6,So  you mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England ?
17,6,6,Yes  that's why Puritans moved to the New World  where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans . Later on  it was these Puritans who founded Harvard College .
18,6,6,Why did they want to found a college ?
19,6,6,Many Puritans had received classic style of higher education in Oxford University and Cambridge University back in England . They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well .
20,6,6,Oh  I see .
21,6,6,Actually Harvard was first named ' New College '  without a formal name .
22,6,6,When did it begin to be called Harvard University ?
23,6,6,In 1639  it was renamed after its major benefactor John Harvard . Interestingly  JohnHarvard himself was a clergyman .
24,6,6,It seems that Harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion .
25,6,6,Therefore  it ' s not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion  there would note Harvard .
26,6,6,Wow  I didn ' t know that religion had played such an important role in Harvard history .
27,6,6,Religion has been playing an indispensible part in Harvard history as well as the U . S .
28,6,6,I finally begin to get to know Harvard . It seems that my knowledge of Harvard is rather poor . I have a lot work to do before applying for Harvard .
29,6,6,Remember that Harvard is a part of the United States . So you have to know the U . S . history and culture if you want to have in-depth knowledge of Harvard . The two are closely related .
30,0,6,That ' s right . I have a lot to learn from you .
31,0,6,You can ask me any question at any time .

2,6,6,I know . Sorry  I shouldn't have rushed you  but I just couldn't stay at home and wait .
3,0,6,Never mind . What about taking a look around the theater ?
4,0,6,Why not ? I'd love to do that .
5,6,6,Here we go . There is a museum of the Beijing Opera art .
6,0,6,Wow . Look at this . So delicate and beautiful . Did ancient Chinese people really wear them ?
7,6,6,Not really . They are just opera costumes . Do you like the embroidery ?
8,6,6,I surely do . They must have had advanced machines in ancient China to do that .
9,6,6,No  no  no . They are all handmade  girl . You know  the ancient Chinese women were supposed to be good at needlework .
10,3,6,Unbelievable ! I could never do that .
11,6,6,Very few can . That's why these clothes only appear in the museum .
12,0,6,Listen ! Some people are singing outside . Is it the opera ?
13,0,6,Oh  yes . I heard there was an opera fans club . They are probably practicing now . Wanna have a look ?
14,0,6,Yes  let's do it .
15,6,6,Follow me . Make sure not to interrupt them .
16,6,6,Of course not . We don't do that .

3,6,6,Mary said that she was really pleased with the photography .
4,2,6,I found it very disappointing .
5,6,6,She liked the acting  too  because that's what she wanted to see .
6,2,6,I wasn't happy with it .

2,0,6,That is a heavy raining afternoon . I was standing under the eaves of a shop to evade the heavy rain . It's getting dark .
3,0,6,And then ?
4,0,6,I was trembling in the wind when he ran to me with an umbrella in his hand and asked  ' Where is your home ? '
5,0,6,Then he sent you to your home ?
6,0,6,Yeah .
7,0,6,It's a romantic meeting . I can say that a hero saves a beauty .
8,0,6,He joked later that I was so poor that he had a kind of impulse to protect an ant .
9,0,6,He is so humorous .

2,1,6,I didn't pass the English exam . How to learn English well ? Can you give me some suggestions ?
3,6,6,Well  English is a " paper tiger " . Its natural enemy is adequate practice .
4,1,6,I have done a lot of reading comprehension exercises  and I also spend much time in memorizing English words .
5,6,6,I suggest you read English texts aloud every day  and try to speak more . That will be beneficial to cultivate your sense of the language .
6,3,6,Really ? I'll have a try . Maybe I will get high marks next time .

4,6,6,You aren ' t going to a strip club  are you ? I don ' t want you getting a lap dance from some stripper with the excuse that it ' s your friends party .
5,6,6,Aw come on ! It ' s just some innocent fun ! You know how these things are ! We are gonna play drinking games  get him some gag gifts and just have a good time . Nothing too over the top .
6,6,6,Well  I don ' t know .
7,6,6,Come on ! If one of your friends was getting married I wouldn ' t mind you going to her bachelorette party !

2,0,6,It was terrific . The concert was really a hit . The symphony orchestra was so good that I was completely absorbed in their performance .
3,6,6,Who was the conductor ?
4,0,6,Oh  speaking of the conductor  he is indeed a genius . He did a perfect job . His name is Menuhin  a descendent of Russian American immigrants .
5,0,6,Oh  I learned that he is also a legendary violinist .
6,0,6,Absolutely right . He gave a performance of Felix Mendelssohn's violin concerto . That caused a sensation . The audience were stunned by his pure tone .
7,0,6,Obviously you did enjoy the concert .
8,0,6,Yes  I did .

2,6,6,Oh  I took up a new hobby .
3,6,6,So you don't travel a lot now ?
4,0,6,No  Frank . I'm much more interested in collecting stamps now .
5,0,6,It's certainly a popular hobby . I know a lot of people love stamps .
6,0,6,It certainly is . It's so much fun .
7,6,6,I believe collecting stamps has something similar to traveling right ?
8,0,6,Absolutely . Through all kinds of stamps I am able to learn about the world .
9,0,6,Well  every stamp has a story to tell .
10,0,6,You're right . And I also meet many new friends while collecting stamps .
11,0,6,Good .
12,6,6,Sometimes we even spend hours discussing our collections .
13,6,6,There's a lot to share when you have a common interest .
14,0,6,Yes  it's really amazing . I got to go now . I'm meeting with some other collectors .
15,0,6,Ok  good luck . See you

1,6,6,Say  Jim  how about going for a few beers after dinner ?
2,6,6,You know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
3,6,6,What do you mean ? It will help us to relax .
4,6,6,Do you really think so ? I don't . It will just make us fat and act silly . Remember last time ?
5,6,6,I guess you are right . But what shall we do ? I don't feel like sitting at home .
6,6,6,I suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
7,0,6,That's a good idea . I hear Mary and Sally often go there to play pingpong . Perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
8,0,6,Sounds great to me ! If they are willing  we could ask them to go dancing with us . That is excellent exercise and fun  too .
9,0,6,Good . Let ' s go now .
10,0,6,All right .

1,6,6,are you working overtime again ? Over the last two weeks  you have worked overtime every day without a break ! Your company is draining the life out of you !
2,6,6,I know  but I don't have a choice  my boss has complete control over our work schedules . I haven't made it out of the office before 9 PM a single day this week .
3,6,6,Well  I hope they're paying you the big bucks for all this work ...
4,6,6,No  not exactly  I'm working for minimum wage . And they don't give extra pay for overtime . Overtime is our own time .
5,3,6,What ? ! Isn't there a law against that  I think there is some legislation that requires employers to give their employees a fair rate of wages . You should know your rights ! If you are putting in so many hours  they should give you some kind of compensation .
6,6,6,They do give bonuses at the end of the year for the employees with highest productivity numbers  but frankly  it's not much of an incentive . They give us a bonus of ten dollars .
7,5,6,That's just wrong ! why don't you just quit ?
8,6,6,I would  but I'm afraid I would't be able to find another job . I don't have very many job marketable skills  there aren't so many jobs that I'm qualified for .
9,5,6,it sounds like any job will be better than the one you have now !

4,2,6,This is terrible . Why do hackers play such a dirty trick ?
5,6,6,Hackers are smart  and they want people to know about it .
6,2,6,So they create viruses to tell people they are smart ? That's really sick .

2,0,6,thanks ; do you like it ?
3,6,6,not really . I was being sarcastic . Does it come with the job ?
4,6,6,yes  everyone on the sales floor has to wear one . They're supposed to make us look more professional .
5,6,6,they're not actually that bad . They could be worse . What do you think about it ?
6,6,6,I don't mind it  actually . I don't have to worry about what I'm going to wear every day .
7,0,6,so are you enjoying your new job ?
8,0,6,it's much better than my old one . My new boss is great .
9,0,6,how do you like working in sales ?
10,0,6,I like the fact that I get to work with people . It makes the day go by much faster .
11,0,6,that's good . Have you met Jane yet ? She's the intern in the international travel department .
12,0,6,yeah  I've met her . She's a genius saleswoman !

16,3,6,why didn't you tell me about that before ?
17,6,6,I don't know . I didn't think it was that interesting .

3,0,6,That's really a good thing . Let's do our part .
4,0,6,Good idea .
5,6,6,Who will sing in the show ?
6,6,6,A lot of stars  including Andy  Justin  Mendy ...
7,0,6,Mendy ? Are you sure ? I love her songs !
8,0,6,Me too . She is so young and talented . She is not only a singer but also a great composer herself .
9,0,6,Yeah . Though she was so popular  I heard she managed to maintain a low profile .
10,0,6,She is a real star . Not a onetime thing .
11,0,6,But I also heard some people didn't like her music . I don't understand why . She is so amazing !
12,0,6,Well  I suppose people have different tastes on music . Moreover  here stuff is really strong and creative . It takes time for people to accept new things .
13,0,6,You are right . Anyway  things will be different as the days go on . She can get it . I have faith in her .
14,0,6,Sure . That makes a good fan . Do you know what songs she is gonna sing tonight ?

4,0,6,That sounds like a good idea . The sky is clear  the sun is shining and there's a nice cool breeze  so it is not too hot .
5,0,6,I really miss the change of seasons like we have in Colorado ; but I must admit  this sure is a nice spring day .
6,0,6,Hey  this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
7,6,6,Okay . Hey  is that a dark cloud over there ? Do you think it will rain after all ?
8,6,6,I don't think so . I say the weather report last night  and it said the weather should be fine all day .

3,6,6,What was that ?
4,6,6,Nothing ! Anyway  you ' re right  there ' s no reason this has to be nasty . My lawyer tells me you ' Ve accepted our alimony proposal and the division of property  as well as the custody agreement-I keep the cat and you get the dog . So that ' s done ... finally .
5,6,6,Let ' s not go there  Joanne ! Ok  so let ' s start with the record collection  I ' ll take the albums I contributed and you can have your cheesy disco albums back .
6,6,6,Fine  but I ' m keeping the antique gramophone as my grandfather gave it to me .
7,5,6,I believe that was a wedding present to both of us  Joanne . And you hardly ever use it !
8,5,6,He ' s my grandfather  and he never really liked you anyway !
9,6,6,Whatever ! Alright  I ' ll concede the silly gramophone  if you ' ll agree that I get the silver tea set .
10,6,6,How typical  when are you ever going to use a silver tea set ? Fine ! I don ' t want to drag this out any longer than necessary . What ' s next ? What about these old photographs ?
11,6,6,Which ones ? Let me have a look . Wow  look at that ! That brings back memories ... That ?
12,6,6,Our trip to Italy ! I remember that day . We were going to visit the Trev fountain  and we got caught in the rain ...
13,0,6,... and you looked so adorable with your hair all wet . I had to take a picture of you standing there in that little alley  smiling and laughing in the rain ...
14,0,6,Oh  we really did have fun back then  didn ' t we ?
15,0,6,Oh  Joanne  are we making a big mistake ? I know our relationship has been on the rocks for sometime but are you sure we can ' t reconcile and try again ? I still love you .
16,0,6,Oh Jeff ! I love you too ! I ' m so glad we didn ' t have to decide who keeps the motorcycle .
17,6,6,The motorcycle ? But that ' s mine !

3,0,6,That ' s fine ! Don ' t worry about it !
4,6,6,What was that ?
5,0,6,Relax  it was just a goat !
6,6,6,And that ?
7,0,6,It ' s just the cows that are grazing over there . We can milk them later .
8,6,6,What was that ?
9,0,6,Honey  seriously  It ' s just a sheep . Relax ! Relax  that was just the horses and donkeys that are in the stable .
10,6,6,You know what ? I don ' t think I can hack it here out in the countryside . I ' m going back to the city !

7,6,6,We've found some heroin at your house .
8,3,6,No  I didn't . I'm innocent . Those aren't mine . Whatever you found is someone else's stuff . You can't prove anything . I wasn't there when you went in  and you can't prove it's my stuff .
9,5,6,That may be  but you're still under arrest . And you'd better stop talking .
10,5,6,I don't need your help  jerk .
11,6,6,Whatever you say .

4,1,6,No . Only a few pounds . But my passport was in the bag . That ' what I ' m really worry about .
5,6,6,You must tell the embassy about it . And I think they ' ll issue you with a new one .
6,1,6,I ' d better go tomorrow .
7,6,6,No . But you mustn ' t leave it too long . Did you report it the police ?
8,1,6,No . I couldn ' t find a policeman .
9,6,6,Well . You must report that it ' s been stolen . And give the police description of your bag . You ' d better go to the local police station tomorrow morning .
10,6,6,Yes . I ' ll do it tomorrow .

3,6,6,I know . But we could get some exercise in  and we could get some errands run  too . Window-shopping won ' t cost you anything .
4,6,6,What kind of errands do we need to run ?
5,6,6,Well  we could go to the newsagent's to pick up the Sunday paper  go to the butcher's to pick up a chicken for a roast dinner  and to the chemist's to pick up your prescription from the doctor .
6,6,6,I'll only go if we can stop at the office-license to pick up something to drink for tonight .
7,6,6,Fine  we'll do that on the way home  so we don ' t have to carry it the whole time .
8,0,6,Sounds good . You have to promise not go into any of the stores in the mall though . I know how you like to try things on in the fitting rooms  especially if the stores have special offers .
9,6,6,I promise . We're only going for a walk to get some exercise and to get some things done that we haven ' t had time for .
10,0,6,Ok  let's go then !
11,6,6,Do you have any money ?
12,6,6,For what ?
13,6,6,For our errands  and maybe a little extra for something from a vendor on the street .
14,5,6,You said you were only going to window shop !
15,5,6,I agreed to not go into the mall  but I can still look at things in the market !

4,6,6,First  I slept through my alarm and ended up two hours late to work .
5,6,6,What did your boss say ?
6,6,6,He told me that if I showed up late one more time  he'd fire me . He's so mean !

8,6,6,That was my second time . The first time  I was in a car accident .
9,6,6,Is your boss Chinese ?
10,6,6,No  he's from Australia . Before I met him  I thought Australians were supposed to be relaxed and easy-going . I had no idea he'd be so fussy about things .
11,6,6,What are you going to do ?

4,6,6,Actually I feel quite rested . I was able to sleep on the plane .
5,0,6,Good ! Here  let me help you with your bag . Is it your first time to Seattle ? I'd be happy to take you around this city and show you the sights tonight if you're up to it .

2,6,6,Oh  my dear lady . Take it easy . You should forgive a green hand like him .
3,5,6,He does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy .
4,6,6,I suggest you talk with him and teach him how to deal with the problems .
5,5,6,I have told him how to do it several times  but he's never listened to me .
6,6,6,Maybe you should communicate with him just like a friend and not a boss .
7,5,6,Oh  I always have difficulty in getting along with the staff .
8,6,6,Just take them for your good friends and have a talk with them as we do  make sure you don't lose your temper .
9,2,6,I think that's a bad idea . I'd hate anyone here to think of me as a friend . How would they ever respect me as they can do whatever they want ?

3,6,6,I must have taken a wrong turn .
4,6,6,It doesn ' t matter . Go back the way you came . After about five kilometers  you ' ll see a hotel on the side of the road . It ' s a big one . You can ' t miss it .

3,5,6,You ' Ve had over a month to get this finalized ! Why are things delayed ?
4,1,6,Well  the thing is  we ran into a lot of problems . . .
5,5,6,I ' m not looking for excuses here . I just want to get this finished on time !
6,6,6,I know  and I apologize for the delay . But some things were just beyond my control . I had trouble booking the photographer  and then Michael was sick for three weeks  so I couldn ' t include him in the photos  and the design team lost all the files  so I had to re-do the pictures .

6,6,6,They are morning glories . They are cute  aren't they ?
7,6,6,They are . We can find many different kinds of flowers and insects in the park .
8,6,6,I think so . Last time I saw dandelions and ladybugs near the pond .
9,6,6,If you come to the park in the morning  you can find squirrels running on the lawn .
10,0,6,It's really healthy to do some exercise there . The air is fresher and it's romantic to watch the sunset with your lover .

8,6,6,You Americans usually have nutritious food .
9,0,6,Oh  but Chinese food is so delicious . I wish I knew how to cook Chinese food . Do you follow recipes ?

1,6,6,Hi  are you being helped ?
2,6,6,No  I'm not . I am interested in some scarves .
3,6,6,All our scarves are in this section . What do you think of this one here ? It's made of silk .
4,0,6,Hm  It looks nice  but I ' d like to have something warm for the winter .
5,6,6,Maybe you would like a heavy wool scarves . How about this one ?
6,0,6,I think that's what I want . How much is it ?
7,6,6,It's 75 dollars plus tax .
8,6,6,It's a little expensive . Do you think it's possible to get a discount ?
9,6,6,Since you like it so much  how about a 10 % discount ? That's the best I can offer .
10,0,6,That's good . Could you wrap it for me ?
11,6,6,Sure . Is there anything else I can get for you ?
12,0,6,No  that should be it . Thank you !

1,5,6,We have been over this a hundred times ! We are not getting a pet !
2,5,6,Why not ? Come on ! Just a cute little puppy or a kitty !
3,6,6,Who is going to look after a dog or a cat ?
4,5,6,I will ! I ' ll feed it  bathe it and walk it every day ! We can get a Labrador or a German Shepard !
5,6,6,What if we want to take a vacation ? Who will we leave it with ? Plus  our apartment is too small for that breed of dog .
6,6,6,Ok . How about we get a cat or a ferret ?
7,6,6,We ' re planning on having children soon  I don ' t think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house .
8,6,6,Fine ! Let ' s get a bird then ! We can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk ! A parrot would be awesome !
9,6,6,I ' ll tell you what  I can get you some hamsters and we ' ll take it from there .
10,0,6,Yay !

4,6,6,No ! Five minutes I promise !
5,6,6,Come on ! We have been here for almost an hour ! I thought you said you were only going to get a few things ! How long does it take you to pick out a lipstick and some nail polish !
6,3,6,Are you crazy ? You have no idea what you are talking about ! Just for my eyes I have to get eye-liner  an eyelash curler  eye shadow  an eyebrow pencil and mascara . Then I need to get foundation  liq
7,5,6,Whoa whoa whoa ! Are you nuts ? How much is all this going to cost ? I ' m looking at the price at each one of these little things and it ' s outrageous ! This is basically a crayon !
8,5,6,What about you ? You spend as much or more money on your razors  after shave  cologne and gel ! Not to mention how much you spend on clothes and ...
9,5,6,Fine ! Get the stupid thirty dollar crayon !

3,6,6,What store did you get it from ?

 (1, 1),(5, 4),(9, 9),(13, 12),(13, 13),
1,0,6,Well  I'm glad you're finally back . I was wondering what happened .
2,6,6,I feel kind of stupid .
3,6,6,Why ?
4,6,6,We got lost coming back . I guess I don't really know this town yet .
5,3,6,You got lost . You're kidding !
6,6,6,No . We took a wrong turn somewhere . And Joseph doesn't know the town at all . So I started giving him directions . But I didn't really know where we were . So we got seriously lost .
7,6,6,You could have called .
8,6,6,I know I could have . But finally we asked someone where we were .
9,3,6,You've been gone for two hours . How could you get lost for so long ?
10,6,6,Guess where we ended up .
11,6,6,I don't know . Where ?
12,6,6,When we finally decided to ask someone  they told us we were in Grangerfield .
13,3,6,Grangerfield ! You were in Grangerfield ? That's a completely different town ! How could you drive to a completely different town ?
14,6,6,I don't know . The person we asked had to give us directions to the highway to get back here .
15,6,6,Grangerfield is like a dozen miles away from here .
16,6,6,I know it is . I don't know how it happened .
17,6,6,Hmm  maybe I do .
18,6,6,What ?
19,6,6,Maybe I have an idea how it happened .
20,6,6,How ?
21,6,6,You were too busy looking at Joseph  and you weren't paying attention to the road .
22,6,6,Oh  that's what you think  huh ?
64 13
 (6, 3),(6, 6),(8, 7),(8, 8),
1,5,6,Oh  come on  Ultraman !
2,6,6,What's up  Bro ? What's in the bulletin ?
3,6,6,It says that there will be a blackout from 5 p . m . to 7 p . m . in our neighborhood today .
4,6,6,Blackout ? Even the TV has the limit .
5,6,6,Don't you know you will look like a monster in the blackout ?
6,5,6,Oops  no  Daddy can't watch American Idol  either !
7,6,6,That's not the point . Come on  can you imagine that there will be no electricity on such a hot day ?
8,4,6,Oh  my god ! No air-conditioner !
9,6,6,OK  since you are the smart one  can you come up with a better plan ? So that we won't be baked like cookies here .
10,6,6,How about playing Barbie out there in the neighborhood ?
11,6,6,Barbie ? You know  I might be seven  but I'm not a girl .
12,6,6,Do you have a better plan ?
13,6,6,All right  all right .

1,0,6,Hey ! I just bought one of those new Japanese cell phones ! It's loaded with extras .
2,6,6,What does it do ?
3,0,6,It's got a built-in video camera so you can see the person you're talking to . It also takes stills and I can use the E-mail mode to send digital pictures straight to my friend's phone !
4,0,6,Wow ! What else does it do ?
5,6,6,I can plug it into a folding keyboard to type in message mode . l can even surf the net .
6,0,6,Cool ! Anything else ?
7,6,6,Yes . With the 600 - second digital memory  l can record my voice and send it using voice message mode .
8,0,6,Wow !
9,0,6,You'll love this ! I can use a stylus to draw a map on the touch screen and then use the fax mode to send it to another phone .

2,6,6,They'll be ready by this afternoon .
3,3,6,Oh  no ! I'm leaving for Japan at 11 this morning .
4,1,6,Is that right ? We're very sorry .
5,6,6,I thought it was " the same day " service . Anyway  please do hurry .
6,1,6,I'm afraid we can't return it by 11 o'clock .
7,6,6,Well  then  would you send it to Japan  please ?
8,6,6,Yes  we'll do so .

 (1, 1),(3, 1),(3, 3),(5, 4),(5, 5),(7, 7),
1,1,6,I'm very worried  doctor . I'm afraid that I'm very ill .
2,6,6,Why do you think so ?
3,1,6,Because I feel tired all the time  even when I wake up in the morning . I find it very difficult to do any work . I have no appetite .
4,6,6,How do you sleep ?
5,1,6,Very badly  doctor .
6,6,6,Are you worried about anything ?
7,1,6,Well  yes  I am . I'm worried about my work . I've just taken a new job . I earn a lot of money but it's difficult work . I'm always afraid of making a mistake .
8,6,6,Well  there's nothing much wrong with you . You're under too much pressure .

1,6,6,Hi  Francis  how was your business trip ?
2,1,6,It was a nightmare .
3,6,6,What ' s up ?
4,6,6,Actually  the business trip itself was very successful . We arrived on time  we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year .
5,6,6,Sounds quite fruitful  why do you call it still a nightmare then ?
6,1,6,Well  the air line lost my luggage on the return flight and then I lost my carry on bag when I was tackling with the officers in charge . I left the airport three hours later than I expected and then I was caught in a traffic jam . When I finally got home  I was totally exhausted . But I found the elevator was out of service due to a blackout .
7,6,6,This is really a sad story . Did they trace back your luggage ?
8,1,6,I am still waiting for their call .
9,6,6,Take it easy  all sufferings have their reward .

6,1,6,Sorry . You'd better get off for taking another taxi .

2,6,6,It's a big bedroom with a drawing room  facing a beautiful wood .
3,6,6,Is there a bathroom ?
4,6,6,No  but there is one downstairs  which my daughter used some years ago .
5,0,6,It sounds good . Could I go and see it myself ?
6,6,6,Certainly  you're welcome anytime .
7,6,6,See you later !
8,6,6,( after a while ) Good afternoon  Mrs . Smith . I called you just now .
9,0,6,Welcome ! Come in  please !
10,6,6,Yes .
11,6,6,This way please . Your room is upstairs ... Here it is .
12,0,6,Wonderful ! A modest  comfortable room . Ah  a beautiful window  through which I can see a beautiful scene  and hear the birds singing . How nice !

4,6,6,Don't cry over spilled milk  Fred ? Could you stay with me a few minutes ?
5,6,6,What ? Why ? What's wrong with you ?
6,1,6,I just hate being alone at home with nothing to do about listen to the clock ticking . It ' s so lonely and boring . My sickness makes it worse . When will I recover ?
7,6,6,You will be fine in the couple of month  just be patient . I've got to woke now  I'll be late .
8,1,6,You only care about your work .
9,6,6,Sorry  baby  you are everything to me . all I do just for our family .
10,6,6,Stay just a few minutes longer  OK ?
11,6,6,OK  I'll leave at 9:15  Is that all right ?
12,0,6,Yes .
13,6,6,I'll spent more time with you in the future  Dina .

3,6,6,Before your main course  would you like to order an appetizer ?
4,0,6,Sure  that sounds great . Where are your appetizers listed ?
5,6,6,There is a special appetizer menu right here in the center of the table .
6,6,6,The chicken and cheese quesadilla looks good . Is that pretty good ?
7,0,6,You know  that is one of my favorites !
8,6,6,OK  I'll take one order of that .
9,6,6,You could choose another appetizer for half price to share .

1,5,6,What are we going to do ? I can't get the car out of this ditch . I'm stuck !
2,6,6,I'm worried  Tom . I haven't seen any other cars for almost an hour .
3,5,6,I know . This is terrible . What can we do ? This snow doesn't stop falling !
4,6,6,I told you we should have stayed in town today . The weather report said 100 percent chance of snow . Why did you want to come up here ?
5,6,6,I wanted to show you the cabin . We only had another half-hour to go .
6,6,6,Well  now we're stuck . What can we do ?
7,6,6,I don't know .
8,6,6,I've heard that when this happens  it's important to save energy .
9,6,6,What do you mean ?
10,6,6,We're stranded here  Tom . We may be here a long time . We need to conserve the gas in the car . The car's energy is what will keep us warm .
11,6,6,I have plenty of gas .
12,6,6,Yes  but the gas and the battery both have to stay working . We can't just let the car run and run . If we do  it will die soon . Then we'll freeze .
13,6,6,So what can we do ?
14,6,6,Turn the lights off . Then  run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . That will conserve the heat as long as possible .
15,0,6,Alright . That's a good idea .
16,6,6,I wish we hadn't come up here . Now we'll probably be here for days .
17,6,6,Days ?
18,6,6,Yes  it happens . That is what happens in big snowstorms . People get stranded for days .
19,3,6,Oh  my God ! It's good we have food .
20,6,6,Probably we'll survive . But turn the car off for about forty-five minutes . Then we'll turn it on again .

 (1, 1),(3, 2),(3, 3),(5, 2),(5, 3),(5, 4),
1,3,6,what happened ? Why didn't he win ?
2,6,6,didn't you hear ? He was disqualified .
3,3,6,how did that happen ? He's so talented ! I thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal !
4,6,6,if he didn't have any drug problems  he would have won .
5,3,6,what ? What kind of drugs was he using ?
6,6,6,he was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster .
7,6,6,I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs .
8,6,6,they are . The reason why they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards .
9,6,6,that's so disappointing . I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs .
10,6,6,I don't think it's right  but I can understand why they might . Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country !
11,6,6,regardless of how much pressure you're under  there's never a good reason to take drugs .
12,6,6,I agree . Hopefully with the new regulations  fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs .
13,6,6,let's hope so .

3,6,6,I need this dress and this suit dry cleaned ASAP !
4,6,6,OK  I can have it ready by the end of the week .
5,4,6,No  you don ' t understand  I need this tomorrow morning ! I accidentally spilled beer all over my wife ' s dress and we have a wedding to attend tomorrow ! She ' s gonna kill me !
6,6,6,OK  I can have it ready tomorrow afternoon  but this suit is also very stained . I can ' t guarantee we can remove it completely .
7,6,6,Fine ! Can you also iron and starch this shirt ?
8,0,6,Certainly .
9,0,6,Great ! This is our secret ! If you see my wife  say nothing to her about this !

2,6,6,Well  little girls seem to love Barbie dolls .
3,0,6,That's perfect . I want to see one .
4,6,6,Here you are -- she's called Digital Barbie .
5,0,6,Oh  I like Digital Barbie ! How much does she cost ?
6,6,6,This Barbie is only $ 29 . 95 .
7,0,6,That's perfect . Let me have her .
8,0,6,Very good . Is there anything else you would like ?
9,6,6,No  that'll do it for now .
10,6,6,Including tax  your total will be $ 32 . 42 . Cash or charge ?

2,6,6,You need to take a break  maybe a vacation .
3,1,6,Oh  yes  indeed . I've run out of steam . To be honest  I want to be in a different environment .
4,3,6,Is that so ?
5,6,6,Yes  I don't want to be stuck in a rut . I want to move on .
6,6,6,Have you decided ?
7,6,6,Yes . I want to get a better job .
8,6,6,Could you tell me why you want to quit ?
9,6,6,I quit just because of the dissatisfying salary and the trouble in getting along with my colleagues .
10,6,6,Oh  that's terrible . Do you want to get a higher salary in our company ?
11,6,6,I'm afraid not . I've promised my girlfriend . We'll travel southwards to find a job that offers higher pay .
12,6,6,OK  I'd like to say that I've really enjoyed working with you . However  I think you should work harder for your new job and then you can ask for higher pay .
13,6,6,Thank you so much for your advice .
14,6,6,And every best wish for your new job .
15,6,6,Thank you .

2,0,6,Good for you . Did you use Paypal ?
3,6,6,Yeah . It was so easy and super-fast  once I figured it out .
4,0,6,That's the beauty of it  and the danger .
5,6,6,I should get the items within a week . But in the meantime I'm bidding on a digital video camera .
6,6,6,How much ?
7,6,6,Thirty U . S . dollars ... and it's only been used for six months .
8,0,6,Mmmm  sounds like risky business . Good luck .

1,0,6,Wow  this is amazing . I'm glad we've come here . So cool .
2,0,6,I always love skiing . You know  it's a cool game for cool people . Stay with me and you will be cool  too .
3,0,6,Hey  look over there . It seems that there is something interesting going on . Let's go and have a look .
4,6,6,Sure . It's probably the skiing show . Adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .
5,6,6,See that . It's so dangerous . My mom would never allow me to do that .
6,6,6,Hey  don't be so pathetic . It's a maximal sports show . What else can they do to attract more visitors ? Stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
7,6,6,You are right . But what if the avalanche happened ?
8,6,6,They are all very experienced and great skiers . So I suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
9,6,6,Anyway  the show is breathtaking . By the way  where did they get so much snow in here ?
10,3,6,Don't you know that ? Are you kidding me ?
