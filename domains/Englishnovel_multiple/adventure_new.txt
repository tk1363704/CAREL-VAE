13,null,null,as an example of it
14,null,null,a bystander who showed fearful scars

3,null,null,but the income he derived from his profession increased so rapidly that he soon had twelve thousand francs safely invested as a resource against any emergency
4,null,null,Madame Ferailleur now laid aside the mourning she had worn since her husband 's death

3,null,null,and which has so frequently been observed among persons condemned to death
4,null,null,on the night preceding their execution
5,null,null,Four or five times his mother came to listen at the door
6,null,null,Once she entered
7,null,null,and seeing her son sleeping soundly
8,null,null,she could not repress a smile of satisfaction

463 17
 (6, 4),
1,null,null,What a change indeed
2,null,null,At last the count made me retire to one of the compartments
3,null,null,where I soon fell asleep
4,null,fear,abandoning my efforts to distinguish what was dreamlike in my situation from reality
5,null,null,However
6,fear,terribly anxious,when I woke up I became terribly anxious
7,null,null,I asked myself what was awaiting me at the end of this long journey
8,null,null,de Chalusse 's manner continued kind
9,null,null,and even affectionate
10,null,null,but he had regained his accustomed reserve and self-control
11,null,null,and I realized that it would be useless on my part to question him
12,null,null,At last
13,null,null,after a thirty hours ' journey by rail
14,null,null,we again entered the count 's berline
15,null,null,drawn by post horses
16,null,null,and eventually M
17,null,null,de Chalusse said to me :  ' here is Cannes we are at our journey 's end . '
464 27
 (12, 9),
1,null,null,He told me that he proposed spending a few months here in seclusion
2,null,null,so as to give me time to accustom myself to my new position and the luxury that surrounded me
3,null,null,I was
4,null,null,indeed
5,null,null,extremely awkward
6,null,null,and my excessive timidity was increased by my pride
7,null,null,I did not know what to say
8,null,null,or what to do
9,null,sadness,I did not know how to use my hands
10,null,null,nor how to walk
11,null,null,nor how to carry myself
12,sadness,embarrassed,Everything embarrassed and frightened me
13,null,null,and I was conscious of my awkwardness
14,null,null,without being able to remedy it
15,null,null,I saw my blunders
16,null,null,and knew that I spoke a different language to that which was spoken around me
17,null,null,And yet the memory of Cannes will ever be dear to me
18,null,null,For there I first met the only friend I have now left in this world
19,null,null,I did not exchange a word with him
20,null,null,but by the quickened throbbing s of my heart
21,null,null,when our eyes met
22,null,null,I felt that he would exert a powerful influence over my life
23,null,null,and events have since proved that I was not deceived
24,null,null,At that time
25,null,null,however
26,null,null,he was a stranger to me
27,null,null,and nothing on earth would have induced me to make inquiries concerning him .
465 22
 (11, 8),
1,null,null,"  By a single word the count could have insured the happiness of my life and his own
2,null,null,but he did not speak it
3,null,null,He was the kindest and most indulgent of guardians
4,null,null,and I was often affected to tears by his tenderness
5,null,null,But
6,null,null,although my slightest wish was law
7,null,null,he did not grant me his confidence
8,null,disgust,the mystery that stood between us was like a wall of ice  Still
9,null,null,I was gradually becoming accustomed to my new life
10,null,null,and my mind was regaining its equilibrium
11,disgust,more agitated and excited,when one evening the count returned home more agitated and excited
12,null,null,if possible
13,null,null,than on the day of my departure from the asylum
14,null,null,He summoned his valet
15,null,null,and
16,null,null,in a tone that admitted no reply
17,null,null,he exclaimed
18,null,null,' i wish to leave Cannes at once  I must start in less than an hour so procure some post horses instantly
19,null,null,And in answer to my inquiring glance
20,null,null,he said :  ' it must be
21,null,null,It would be folly to hesitate
22,null,null,Each moment increases the peril that threatens us . '
467 11
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,When that day comes I will go to your guardian and ask him for your hand
2,null,null,but in Heaven 's name dont speak now
3,null,null,I understood Pascal 's motives well enough
4,null,null,The count 's immense fortune frightened him
5,fear,fear,and he feared that he would be accused of being a fortune hunter
6,null,null,So I waited
7,null,null,with that secret anguish which still haunts those who have been unhappy even when their present is peaceful
8,null,null,and their future seems bright
9,null,null,I kept my secret
10,null,null,saying to myself that such happiness was not meant for me
11,null,null,that it would soon take flight .

3,null,null,the pressure of a hand through the garden gate
4,null,null,and that is all
5,null,null,Still
6,null,null,I have been guilty of a grave and irreparable fault :  I have disobeyed the one rule of my life frankness
7,null,null,and I am cruelly punished for doing so
8,null,null,I did not tell all this to M
9,null,null,de Chalusse in fact
10,null,null,I dared not
11,sadness,sadness,I was ashamed of my cowardice
12,null,null,from day to day I vowed that I would confess everything
13,null,null,and yet I procrastinated
14,null,null,I said to myself every night
15,null,null,' it shall be done to-morrow
16,null,null,but when the morrow came I said
17,null,null,' i will give myself another day just one more day
18,null,null,Indeed
19,null,null,my courage failed me when I thought of the count 's aristocratic prejudices
20,null,null,and besides
21,null,null,I knew how ambitious he was for my future .
471 7
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,I did not wish to bind him by the advice which he would certainly have given me
2,null,null,I had his troth
3,null,null,and that sufficed
4,null,null,And it was with a thrill of joy that I said to myself :  ' what does it matter if M
5,anger,anger,de Chalusse should be so angered by my refusal to obey him as to drive me from his house
6,null,null,It will rather be so much the better
7,null,null,Pascal will protect me . '
478 14
 (5, 4),
1,null,null,She spoke these words with a sort of satisfaction
2,null,null,expecting that the marquis would betray his disappointed covetousness by some significant gesture or exclamation
3,null,null,and she was already prepared to rejoice at his confusion
4,null,sadness,But her expectations were not realized
5,sadness,slightest dismay or even regret,Instead of evincing the slightest dismay or even regret
6,null,null,de Valorsay drew a long breath
7,null,null,as if a great burden had been lifted from his heart
8,null,null,and his eyes sparkled with apparent delight
9,null,null,"  Then I may venture to speak
10,null,null,"   he exclaimed
11,null,null,with unconcealed satisfaction
12,null,null,"  I will speak
13,null,null,mademoiselle
14,null,null,if you will deign to allow me .  "

2,sadness,sadness,and Marguerite was so overwhelmed by this last and unexpected misfortune
3,null,null,that she could hardly stagger back to the vehicle
4,null,null,"  Gone
5,null,null,"   she murmured
6,null,null,"  gone
7,null,null,without a thought of me
8,null,null,Or does he believe me to be like all the rest
9,null,null,But I will find him again

2,happiness,happiness,and it was with a feeling of pride that he saw his noble client depart
3,null,null,white and speechless with rage
4,null,null,"  What a rascal that marquis is
5,null,null,"   he muttered
6,null,null,"  I would certainly warn Mademoiselle Marguerite
7,null,null,poor girl
8,null,null,if I were not so much afraid of him .  "
489 9
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,As he received high wages
2,null,null,he served passably well
3,null,null,but he employed the best part of his energy in watching the count
4,null,null,He scented some great family secret in the household
5,anger,anger,and he felt angry and humiliated that this secret had not been entrusted to his discretion
6,null,null,And if he had discovered nothing
7,null,null,it was because M
8,null,null,de Chalusse had been caution personified
9,null,null,as Madame Leon had declared .
492 22
 (11, 11),
1,null,null,Having finished the letter
2,null,null,Casimir laid it on the table
3,null,null,and poured out a glass full of brandy
4,null,null,which he drained at a single draught
5,null,null,"  And that 's all
6,null,null,"   he remarked
7,null,null,"  No signature not even an initial

15,null,null,"  If I had time
16,null,null,"   he resumed
17,null,null,"  I should make some inquiries about this Madame Lucy Huntley a feigned name
18,null,null,evidently
19,null,null,I should like to know   But what 's the matter with you
20,null,null,Monsieur Fortunat
21,null,null,You are as pale as death
22,null,null,Are you ill

 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Fortunat did not know what to reply
2,surprise,surprise,The question took him completely by surprise
3,null,null,and feeling that his answer would have a very considerable influence upon what might follow
4,null,null,he hesitated .
496 17
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,The dismissal was so imperious that M
2,null,null,Fortunat bowed and went off
3,null,null,completely bewildered by this denouement
4,null,null,"  She 's crazy
5,null,null,"   he said to himself
6,null,null,"  Crazy in the fullest sense of the word
7,fear,fear,She refuses the count 's millions from a silly fear of telling people that she belongs to the Chalusse family
8,null,null,She threatened her brother
9,null,null,but she would never have carried her threats into execution
10,null,null,And she prefers her present position to such a fortune
11,null,null,What lunacy
12,null,null,"   But
13,null,null,although he was disappointed and angry
14,null,null,he did not by any means despair

1,null,null,As I bent to my oar

3,null,null,Here were half the crew guilty of an act of violence upon an officer
4,null,null,which
5,null,null,according to the severe code under which we lived
6,null,null,merited punishment as painful as could be inflicted
7,null,null,and lasting for the rest of the voyage .
708 10
 (6, 3),
1,null,null,Marguerite at once understood that as Madame Leon knew that the marquis was among the funeral guests
2,null,null,she had gone to warn him of Madame de Fondege 's presence
3,null,disgust,This trivial circumstance proved that Mde Fondege 's interests were opposed to those of Mde Valorsay
4,null,null,that they must

7,null,null,and that
8,null,null,with a little patience and skill

10,null,null,one against the other .
709 6
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,He sprang out
2,null,null,assisted his employer into the cab
3,null,null,and bade the driver return to the Place de la Bourse
4,sadness,sadness,It was really pitiful to see the despair which had succeeded Fortunat 's joyful confidence
5,null,null,"  This is the end of everything
6,null,null,"   he groaned .
710 9
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,Fortunat left the restaurant
2,null,null,almost on the run
3,fear,fear,for he feared that he might be pursued and overtaken by MCasimir
4,null,null,But after he had gone a couple of hundred paces
5,null,null,he paused
6,null,null,not so much to take breath
7,null,null,as to collect his scattered wits
8,null,null,and though the weather was cold
9,null,null,he seated himself on a bench to reflect .

2,null,surprise,but looking carefully at him I recognised him to be the captain of the ship upon which I had made my second voyage
3,null,null,though he had altered much since that time
4,null,null,As for him
5,null,null,believing me to be dead it was no wonder that he had not recognised me .
764 14
 (4, 2),
1,null,null,How long I slept I know not
2,null,sadness,but when I opened my eyes and started to my feet I perceived with horror that I was alone and that the ship was gone
3,null,null,I rushed to and fro like one distracted
4,sadness,despair,uttering cries of despair
5,null,null,and when from the shore I saw the vessel under full sail just disappearing upon the horizon
6,null,null,I wished bitterly enough that I had been content to stay at home in safety
7,null,null,But since wishes could do me no good
8,null,null,I presently took courage and looked about me for a means of escape
9,null,null,When I had climbed a tall tree I first of all directed my anxious glances towards the sea
10,null,null,but
11,null,null,finding nothing hopeful there
12,null,null,I turned landward
13,null,null,and my curiosity was excited by a huge dazzling white object
14,null,null,so far off that I could not make out what it might be .

6,null,null,I could not understand or imagine why he should regard my question as strange or unnatural
7,null,null,On the contrary
8,null,null,I thought it perfectly natural
9,null,null,dictated as it had been by circumstances
10,null,null,and by the count 's own words and manner .

5,null,null,he paused
6,null,null,not so much to take breath
7,null,null,as to collect his scattered wits
8,null,null,and though the weather was cold
9,null,null,he seated himself on a bench to reflect .

5,null,null,She rose to the waves of sound as a swimmer rises in the sea
6,null,null,her heart beat fast

1,null,null,I had hardly done reckoning them up when two or three bustling men came out and shepherded us all energetically into a long

1,null,null,As night fell
2,null,null,the condition of the  "  greenies

1730 12
 (8, 9),
1,null,null,Suddenly one of the men
2,null,null,in lifting his net
3,null,null,slipped on the smooth bottom of the boat
4,null,null,jolting one of the oars
5,null,null,There was a gleam of light below as the school turned they had all disappeared instantly
6,null,null,We had been so busy that we had not noticed the dimensions of our catch
7,null,null,but now
8,happiness,great joy,to our great joy
9,null,happiness,we found that we had at least eight hundred fish nearly as large as herrings
10,null,null,We at once returned to the ship
11,null,null,having been absent only two hours
12,null,null,during which we had caught sufficient to provide all hands with three good meals .

 (8, 8),
1,null,null,Now
2,null,null,with us
3,null,null,whenever the weather was doubtful or squally looking
4,null,null,we shortened sail
5,null,null,and kept it fast till better weather came along
6,null,null,being quite careless whether we made one mile a day or one hundred
7,null,null,But just because nobody took any notice of our progress as the days passed
8,fear,fear,we were occasionally startled to find how far we had really got
9,null,null,This was certainly the case with all of us forward
10,null,null,even to me who had some experience
11,null,null,so well used had I now become to the leisurely way of getting along .
1734 12
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,We saw none
2,null,null,however
3,null,null,and at daylight we weighed and towed the ship out to sea with the boats
4,null,null,there being no wind
5,null,null,While busy at this uninteresting pastime
6,null,null,one of the boats slipped away
7,null,null,returning presently with a fine turtle
8,surprise,surprise,which they had surprised during his morning 's nap
9,null,null,e of the amphibious Portuguese slipped over the boat 's side as she neared the sleeping SPHARGA

 (1, 3),
1,happiness,happy,When we got on board we felt quite happy
2,null,null,and
3,null,happiness,for the first time since leaving America
4,null,null,we had a little singing
5,null,null,all I be laughed at when I confess that our musical efforts were confined to Sankey 's hymns
1737 6
 (5, 6),
1,null,null,but as we secured five of them
2,null,null,averaging seven barrels each
3,null,null,with scarcely any trouble
4,null,null,I felt quite pleased with myself
5,happiness,exciting,We had quite an exciting bit of sport with them
6,null,happiness,they were so lively .
1738 4
 (1, 1),
1,fear,fear,The chief anxiety was for the safety of the boats
2,null,null,t as for danger well
3,null,null,they only seemed like big  "  black fish "   to us now

4,happiness,Happily,Happily
5,null,null,there were two boats disengaged
6,null,happiness,so that they were able very promptly to rescue the sufferers from their perilous position in the boiling vortex of foam by which they were surrounded
7,null,null,Meanwhile
8,null,null,the remaining boat had an easy task .
1744 8
 (5, 6),
1,null,null,Since leaving port we had not felt so comfortable

5,sadness,poor,Alas for poor Jemmy
6,null,sadness,as we always persisted in calling him from inability to pronounce his proper name his case was evidently hopeless
7,null,null,His fellows did their poor best to comfort his fast fleeting hours
8,null,null,one after another murmuring to him the prayers of the Church .
1745 8
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,Once clear of the southern end of Formosa we had quite a rapid run to the Bonins
2,null,null,carrying a press of sail day and night
3,null,null,as the skipper was anxious to arrive there on account of his recent injuries
4,null,null,He was still very lame
5,fear,fear,and he feared that some damage might have been done to him of which he was ignorant
6,null,null,Besides
7,null,null,it was easy to see that he did not altogether like anybody else being in charge of his ship
8,null,null,no matter how good they were .
1746 12
 (7, 6),
1,null,null,The chief was looking astern at some finbacks
2,null,null,the look-out men forward were both staring to leeward
3,null,null,thus for a minute or so I had a small arc of the horizon to myself
4,null,null,The time was short
5,null,null,but it sufficed
6,null,happiness,and for the first time that voyage I had the privilege of  "  raising "   a sperm whale
7,happiness,excitement,My voice quivered with excitement as I uttered the war whoop
8,null,null,"  Ah blo o o o w
9,null,null,"   Round spun the mate on his heel
10,null,null,while the hands clustered like bees roused from their hive
11,null,null,"  Where away where
12,null,null,"   gasped the mate .
1748 7
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,Consequently the state of the ship was filthy
2,null,null,nor could all our efforts keep her clean
3,null,null,This farmyard condition of things was permitted to continue for about a week
4,null,null,when the officers got so tired of it
5,anger,anger,and the captain so annoyed at the frequent loss of fowls by their flying overboard
6,null,null,that the edict went forth to feed the foremast hands on poultry till further orders
7,null,null,Great was our delight at the news .
1752 10
 (5, 4),
1,null,null,however
2,null,null,resulted in their getting a severe dressing down in the forecastle
3,null,null,where good order was now kept
4,null,happiness,There had been no need for interference on the part of the officers
5,happiness,glad,which I was glad to see
6,null,null,remembering what would have happened under such circumstances not long ago
7,null,null,Being short-handed
8,null,null,the captain engaged a number of friendly islanders for a limited period
9,null,null,on the understanding that they were to be discharged at their native place
10,null,null,Vau Vau .
1753 9
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,I felt sure
2,null,null,however
3,null,null,that we should have but little more trouble with our fish
4,null,null,In fact
5,fear,fear,I was half afraid that he would die before getting to the surface
6,null,null,in which case he might sink and be lost
7,null,null,We hauled steadily away
8,null,null,the line not coming in very easily
9,null,null,until I judged there was only about another hundred fathoms out .
1756 7
 (4, 4),(4, 5),
1,null,null,At that last titanic effort of his he had rushed downward with such terrific force that
2,null,null,striking his head on the bottom
3,null,null,he had broken his neck
4,sadness,sadness,I felt very grieved that we had lost the chance of securing him
5,null,sadness,but it was perfectly certain that before we could get help to raise him
6,null,null,all that would be left of his skeleton would be quite valueless to us
7,null,null,So with such patience as we could command we waited near the entrance until the receding ebb made it possible for us to emerge once more into the blessed light of day .
1758 9
 (3, 3),(3, 4),
1,null,null,Why are good folks ashore systematically misled into the belief that the sailor is an object of charity
2,null,null,and that it is necessary to subscribe continually and liberally to provide him with food and shelter when ashore
3,surprise,surprise,Most of the contributors would be surprised to know that the cost of board and lodging at the  "  home "   is precisely the same as it is outside
4,null,surprise,and much higher than a landsman of the same grade can live for in better style
5,null,null,With the exception of the sleeping accommodation
6,null,null,most men prefer the boarding-house
7,null,null,where
8,null,null,if they preserve the same commercial status which is a SINE QUA NON at the  "  home
9,null,null,"   they are treated like gentlemen
1763 9
 (6, 9),
1,null,null,Nothing of advantage to our cargo was seen for a long time
2,null,null,which
3,null,null,although apparently what was to be expected
4,null,null,did not improve Captain Slocum 's temper
5,null,null,But
6,surprise,surprise,to the surprise of all
7,null,null,when we had arrived off the beautiful island of Hong Kong
8,null,null,to which we approached closely
9,null,surprise,we  "  raised "   a grand sperm whale .
1764 9
 (5, 6),
1,null,null,For the boat was crumbled into innumerable fragments
2,null,null,and the three hundred fathoms of line

1765 10
 (5, 5),(5, 6),
1,null,null,When morning dawned we hove to

3,null,null,and finished taking on board our  "  head matter "   without further incident
4,null,null,The danger past
5,happiness,happiness,we were all well pleased that the captain was below
6,null,happiness,for the work proceeded quite pleasantly under the genial rule of the mate
7,null,null,Since leaving port we had not felt so comfortable
8,null,null,the work
9,null,null,with all its dis agreeable s
10,null,null,seeming as nothing now that we could do it without fear and trembling .

3,null,null,what chance was there of being saved if your boat got smashed

5,null,null,At last

7,null,null,I went aft to get a drink of water before turning in
8,null,null,The harpooner s and other petty officers were grouped in the waist
9,null,null,earnestly discussing the pros and cons of attack upon whales .
1770 10
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,He raised a gigantic tail on high
2,null,null,threshing the water with deafening blows
3,null,null,rolling at the same time from side to side until the surrounding sea was white with froth
4,anger,anger,I felt in an agony lest we should be crushed under one of those fearful strokes
5,null,null,for Mr
6,null,null,Count appeared to be oblivious of possible danger
7,null,null,although we seemed to be now drifting back on to the writhing leviathan
8,null,null,In the agitated condition of the sea
9,null,null,it was a task of no ordinary difficulty to un ship the tall mast
10,null,null,which was of course the first thing to be done .

5,null,null,Slowly the enormous mass rose
6,null,null,canting the ship heavily as it came
7,disgust,disgust,while every stick and rope aloft complained of the great strain upon them
8,null,null,When at last it was safely shipped
9,null,null,and the tackles cast off
10,null,null,the size of this small portion of a full-grown cachalot 's body could be realized
11,null,null,not before .

 (10, 10),
1,null,null,The share of profits was so small
2,null,null,and the time taken to earn it so long
3,null,null,such a number of clothes were worn out and destroyed by us
4,null,null,only to be replaced from the ship 's slop chest at high prices
5,null,null,that I had quite resigned myself to the prospect of leaving the vessel in debt
6,null,null,whenever that desirable event might happen
7,null,null,Since
8,null,null,therefore
9,null,null,I had never made it a practice to repine at the inevitable
10,sadness,sadness,and make myself unhappy by the contemplation of misfortunes I was powerless to prevent
11,null,null,I tried to interest myself as far as was possible in gathering information

 (4, 4),

2,null,null,the mate allowed him to run at his will
3,null,null,without for the time attempting to haul any closer to him

5,null,null,But he had not gone a couple of miles before he turned a complete somersault in the water
6,null,null,coming up BEHIND us to rush off again in the opposite direction at undiminished speed .
1794 13
 (9, 9),
1,null,null,As soon as they had got far enough away from their native element
2,null,null,we rushed upon them

5,null,null,We had also a  "  jumper
6,null,null,"   or blouse

1801 5
 (5, 4),

6,null,null,never going very near the land on account of the great and numerous dangers attendant upon coasting in those localities to any but those continually engaged in such a business .
1806 11
 (9, 9),
1,null,null,The truth of Mr
2,null,null,Count 's forecast was verified to the hilt
3,null,null,for we found that the captain was so badly bruised about

8,null,null,no matter how good they were .
1811 7
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,As I bent to my oar
2,sadness,sadness,I felt very sorry for what had happened
3,null,null,Here were half the crew guilty of an act of violence upon an officer
4,null,null,which
5,null,null,according to the severe code under which we lived
6,null,null,merited punishment as painful as could be inflicted
7,null,null,and lasting for the rest of the voyage .
1814 12
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,Meanwhile another ship was working up from to leeward
2,null,null,having evidently noted our movements
3,null,null,or else
4,null,null,like the albatross
5,null,null,"  smelt whale
6,null,null,"   no great distance to windward of him
7,happiness,happiness,Waiting for that whale to rise was one of the most exciting experiences we had gone through as yet
8,null,null,with two other ships so near
9,null,null,Everybody 's nerves seemed strung up to concert pitch
10,null,null,and it was quite a relief when from half a dozen throats at once burst the cry
11,null,null,"  There she white waters
12,null,null,Ah blo o o o w
1816 5
 (3, 2),(3, 3),
1,null,null,It was a very pretty tangle
2,null,anger,but our position was rather bad
3,anger,anger,The whale between us was tearing the bowels of the deep up in his rage and fear
4,null,null,we were struggling frantically to get our sail down
5,null,null,and at any moment that wretched iron through our upper strake might tear a plank out of us .
1822 6
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,Consequently the state of the ship was filthy
2,null,null,nor could all our efforts keep her clean
3,null,null,This farmyard condition of things was permitted to continue for about a week
4,null,null,when the officers got so tired of it
5,anger,anger,and the captain so annoyed at the frequent loss of fowls by their flying overboard
6,null,null,that the edict went forth to feed the foremast hands on poultry till further orders .
1824 10
 (3, 4),
1,null,null,Two and a half hours of energetic work was required of us before we got on terms with the fleeing monsters
2,null,null,but at last
3,happiness,joy,to our great joy
4,null,happiness,they broke water from sounding right among us
5,null,null,It was a considerable surprise
6,null,null,but we were all ready
7,null,null,and before they had spouted twice
8,null,null,three boats were fast
9,null,null,only myself keeping out
10,null,null,in accordance with my instructions .

1828 12
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,We took them on board
2,null,null,and the boat returned again
3,null,null,By the time the slack came we had about four hundred and fifty fathoms out a goodly heap to pile up loose in our stern sheets
4,null,null,I felt sure
5,null,null,however
6,null,null,that we should have but little more trouble with our fish
7,null,null,in fact
8,fear,fear,I was half afraid that he would die before getting to the surface
9,null,null,in which case he might sink and be lost
10,null,null,We hauled steadily away
11,null,null,the line not coming in very easily
12,null,null,until I judged there was only about another hundred fathoms out .
1837 7
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,The captain shook hands with me cordially
2,null,null,pooh poohing the loss of the boat as an unavoidable incident of the trade
3,happiness,happiness,but expressing his heart-felt delight at getting us all back safe
4,null,null,The whale we had killed was ample compensation for the loss of several boats
5,null,null,though such was the vigour with which the sharks were going for him
6,null,null,that it was deemed advisable to cut in at once
7,null,null,working all night .
1841 6
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,but ten thousand times better thus than such scenes of lust let loose and abandoned animal ism as we witnessed at Honolulu
2,happiness,happiness,What pleased me mightily was the absence of the white man with his air of superiority and sleek overlordship
3,null,null,All the worship
4,null,null,all the management of affairs
5,null,null,was entirely in the hands of the natives themselves
6,null,null,and excellently well did they manage everything .
1844 8
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,That being settled
2,null,null,we anchored the boat
3,null,null,and lit pipes
4,null,null,preparatory to passing as comfortable a night as might be under the circumstances
5,disgust,disgust,the only thing troubling me being the anxiety of the skipper on our behalf
6,null,null,Presently the blackness beneath was lit up by a wide band of phosphoric light
7,null,null,shed in the wake of no ordinary sized fish
8,null,null,probably an immense shark .
1845 9
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,But we lost no time in getting back to the ship
2,null,null,where I fully expected a severe wigging for the scrape my luckless curiosity had led me into
3,null,null,The captain
4,null,null,however
5,null,null,was very kind
6,happiness,happiness,expressing his pleasure at seeing us all safe back again
7,null,null,although he warned me solemnly against similar investigations in future
8,null,null,A hearty meal and a good rest did wonders in removing the severe effects of our adventure
9,null,null,so that by next morning we were all fit and ready for the days work again .
1847 8
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,Taking stock of him quietly during our day-long leisurely cruises in the boat
2,null,null,I often wondered whether his mind still kept its gloomy forebodings
3,null,null,and brooded over his tragical life-history
4,null,null,I never dared to speak to him on the subject
5,fear,fear,for fear of arousing what I hoped was growing too faint for remembrance
6,null,null,But at times I saw him in the moonlit evenings sitting on the rail alone
7,null,null,steadfastly gazing down into the star besprent waters beneath him
8,null,null,as if coveting their unruffled peace .
1852 5
 (3, 3),(3, 4),(3, 5),
1,null,null,Why are good folks ashore systematically misled into the belief that the sailor is an object of charity
2,null,null,and that it is necessary to subscribe continually and liberally to provide him with food and shelter when ashore
3,surprise,surprise,Most of the contributors would be surprised to know that the cost of board and lodging at the  "  home "   is precisely the same as it is outside
4,null,surprise,and much higher than a landsman of the same grade can live for in better style With the exception of the sleeping accommodation
5,null,surprise,most men prefer the boarding-house .
1862 12
 (9, 9),
1,null,null,There were sixteen white men on board the CHANCE
2,null,null,including the skipper
3,null,null,drawn as usual from various European and American sources
4,null,null,the rest of her large crew of over forty all told being made up of Maories and half-breeds
5,null,null,One common interest united them
6,null,null,making them the most jolly crowd I ever saw their devotion to their commander
7,null,null,There was here to be found no jealousy of the Maories being officers and harpooner s
8,null,null,no black looks or discontented murmuring
9,happiness,happiness,all hands seemed particularly well satisfied with their lot in all its bearings
10,null,null,so that
11,null,null,although the old tub was malodorous enough to turn even a pretty strong stomach
12,null,null,it was a leasure to visit her cheerful crowd for the sake of their enlivening society .
1864 9
 (5, 7),
1,null,null,His crew
2,null,null,on the impulse of the moment
3,null,null,sprang to the rail and cheered with might and main
4,null,null,No one could gainsay that they had good reason
5,fear,feared,but I really feared for a time that we should have  "  ructions
6,null,null,"   As Paddy said
7,null,fear,it was not wise or dignified for those officers to be so angry with him on account of his success
8,null,null,which he frankly owned was due almost entirely to the local knowledge he possessed
9,null,null,gained in many years study of the immediate neighbourhood .
1866 11
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,This announcement
2,null,null,though expected for some time past
3,null,null,gave an amazing fillip to everybody 's interest in the work
4,surprise,surprise,The strange spectacle was witnessed of all hands being anxious to quit a snug harbour for the sea
5,null,null,where stern
6,null,null,hard wrestling with the elements was the rule
7,null,null,The captain
8,null,null,well pleased with the eagerness manifested
9,null,null,had his boat manned for a trip to the entrance of the harbour
10,null,null,to see what the weather was like outside
11,null,null,since it was not possible to judge from where the ship lay .
1870 11
 (10, 10),
1,null,null,For the next four days and nights
2,null,null,during which the wind prevented the CHANCE from leaving us
3,null,null,our old ship was a scene of wild revelry
4,null,null,that ceased not through the twenty-four hours  revelry entirely unassisted by strong waters
5,null,null,too
6,null,null,the natural ebullient gaiety of men who were free from anxiety on any account whatever
7,null,null,rejoicing over the glad consummation of more than two years toil
8,null,null,on the one hand
9,null,null,on the other
10,happiness,happiness,a splendid sympathy in joy manifested by the satisfied crew under the genial command of Captain Gilroy
11,null,null,With their cheerful help we made wonderful progress
1895 13
 (8, 7),
1,null,null,We spent ten happy days in Honolulu
2,null,null,marred only by one or two drunken rows among the chaps forward
3,null,null,which
4,null,null,however
5,null,null,resulted in their getting a severe dressing down in the forecastle
6,null,null,where good order was now kept
7,null,happiness,There had been no need for interference on the part of the officers
8,happiness,glad,which I was glad to see
9,null,null,remembering what would have happened under such circumstances not long ago
10,null,null,Being short-handed
11,null,null,the captain engaged a number of friendly islanders for a limited period
12,null,null,on the understanding that they were to be discharged at their native place
13,null,null,Vau Vau .

2,null,null,the chasm became wider

5,null,surprise,a broad level road at the bottom of the abyss and illumined as far as the eye could reach by what seemed artificial gas lamps placed at regular intervals
6,null,null,as in the thoroughfare of a great city
7,null,null,and I heard confusedly at a distance a hum as of human voices .
1928 13
 (9, 10),
1,null,null,When the cage stopped
2,null,null,I found myself on a ridge of rock
3,null,null,and below me
4,null,null,the chasm
5,null,null,taking a slanting direction
6,null,null,shot down to a considerable depth
7,null,null,the darkness of which my lamp could not have penetrated
8,null,null,But through it

10,null,happiness,streamed upward a steady brilliant light

6,null,surprise,they did show him something :   the arch of a high doorway  approached by a low terrace of steps
7,null,null,in the depth of which - it  formed a dim vestibule - the raising of a curtain at the moment he  passed gave him a glimpse of an avenue of gloom with a glow of  tapers at the end .
