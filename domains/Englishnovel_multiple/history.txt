6,null,anger,She was running deep with ambition
7,null,anger,and she was all the more conspicuous

9,null,null,because she reflected in her own consciousness her social defects

10,null,null,but set it aside .
1264 14

5,null,null,but it was too dark to see anything
6,null,null,then she looked at the sides of the well
7,null,null,and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book shelves
8,null,null,here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs . She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed
9,null,null,it was labelled  ' ORANGE MARMALADE '
10,fear,fear,but to her great disappointment it was empty :  she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody
11,null,null,so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it  Well
12,null,null,' thought Alice to herself
13,null,null,after such a fall as this
14,null,null,I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs
15,null,null,How brave they 'll all think me at home
16,null,null,Why
17,null,null,I would n't say anything about it
18,null,null,even if I fell off the top of the house
1914 11
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,And so it was indeed :  she was now only ten inches high
2,null,null,and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden First
3,null,null,however
4,fear,fear,she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further :  she felt a little nervous about this
5,null,null,for it might end
6,null,null,you know
7,null,null,' said Alice to herself
8,null,null,in my going out altogether
9,null,null,like a candle . I wonder what I should be like then
10,null,null,' And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out
11,null,null,for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing
1915 22
 (17, 17),
1,null,null,Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table :  she opened it
2,null,null,and found in it a very small cake
3,null,null,on which the words  ' EAT ME ' were beautifully marked in currants Well
4,null,null,i 'll eat it
5,null,null,' said Alice
6,null,null,and if it makes me grow larger
7,null,null,I can reach the key
8,null,null,and if it makes me grow smaller
9,null,null,I can creep under the door
10,null,null,so either way i 'll get into the garden
11,null,null,and I dont care which happens
12,null,null,' She ate a little bit
13,null,null,and said anxiously to herself
14,null,null,Which way
15,null,null,Which way
16,null,null,holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing
17,surprise,surprise,and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size :  to be sure
18,null,null,this generally happens when one eats cake
19,null,null,but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen
20,null,null,that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way
21,null,null,she set to work
22,null,null,and very soon finished off the cake .

5,null,surprise,She threw me a bit
6,surprise,surprise,which to the surprise of everybody
7,null,null,I caught and threw it into my mouth

1,null,null,Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice
2,null,null,as she went hunting about
3,null,null,and called out to her in an angry tone
4,null,null,Why
5,null,null,Mary Ann
6,null,null,what ARE you doing out here
7,null,null,Run home this moment
8,null,null,and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan
9,null,null,Quick
10,null,null,now
11,null,null,' And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to
12,null,null,without trying to explain the mistake it had made He took me for his housemaid
13,surprise,surprise,' she said to herself as she ran How surprised he 'll be when he finds out who I am
14,null,null,But i 'd better take him his fan and gloves that is
15,null,null,if I can find them
16,null,null,As she said this
17,null,null,she came upon a neat little house
18,null,null,on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name  WRABBIT engraved upon it . She went in without knocking
19,null,null,and hurried upstairs

10,null,null,' Alice said to herself
11,null,null,to be going messages for a rabbit
12,null,null,I suppose Dinah'll be sending me on messages next
13,null,null,' And she began fancying the sort of thing that would happen :    "  Miss Alice
14,null,null,Come here directly
15,null,null,and get ready for your walk
16,null,null,"    "  Coming in a minute

 (19, 18),
1,null,null,Alas
2,null,null,it was too late to wish that
3,null,null,She went on growing
4,null,null,and growing
5,null,null,and very soon had to kneel down on the floor :  in another minute there was not even room for this
6,null,null,and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door
7,null,null,and the other arm curled round her head . Still she went on growing
8,null,null,and
9,null,null,as a last resource
10,null,null,she put one arm out of the window
11,null,null,and one foot up the chimney
12,null,null,and said to herself  Now I can do no more
13,null,null,whatever happens What WILL become of me
14,null,null,' Luckily for Alice
15,null,null,the little magic bottle had now had its full effect
16,null,null,and she grew no larger :  still it was very uncomfortable
17,null,null,and
18,null,sadness,as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again
19,sadness,unhappy,no wonder she felt unhappy  It was much more pleasant at home
20,null,null,' thought poor Alice
21,null,null,when one wasnt always growing larger and smaller
22,null,null,and being ordered about by mice and rabbits I almost wish I had not gone down that rabbit hole and yet and yet it 's rather curious
23,null,null,you know
24,null,null,this sort of life
25,null,null,I do wonder what CAN have happened to me
26,null,null,When I used to read fairy-tales
27,null,null,I fancied that kind of thing never happened
28,null,null,and now here I am in the middle of one
29,null,null,There ought to be a book written about me
30,null,null,that there ought
31,null,null,And when I grow up
32,null,null,i 'll write one but im grown-up now
33,null,null,' she added in a sorrowful tone
34,null,null,at least there 's no room to grow up any more HERE . '
2052 16
 (10, 10),
1,null,null,A barrow full of WHAT
2,null,null,' thought Alice
3,null,null,but she had not long to doubt
4,null,null,for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window
5,null,null,and some of them hit her in the face i 'll put a stop to this
6,null,null,' she said to herself
7,null,null,and shouted out
8,null,null,you 'd better not do that again
9,null,null,' which produced another dead silence
10,surprise,surprise,Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor
11,null,null,and a bright idea came into her head If I eat one of these cakes
12,null,null,' she thought
13,null,null,it 's sure to make SOME change in my size
14,null,null,and as it cant possibly make me larger
15,null,null,it must make me smaller
16,null,null,I suppose . '

 (7, 8),
1,null,null,An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes
2,null,null,and feebly stretching out one paw
3,null,null,trying to touch her Poor little thing
4,null,null,' said Alice
5,null,null,in a coaxing tone
6,null,null,and she tried hard to whistle to it
7,fear,frightened,but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry
8,null,fear,in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing Hardly knowing what she did
9,null,null,she picked up a little bit of stick
10,null,null,and held it out to the puppy
11,null,null,whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once
12,null,null,with a yelp of delight
13,null,null,and rushed at the stick
14,null,null,and made believe to worry it
15,null,null,then Alice dodged behind a great thistle
16,null,null,to keep herself from being run over
17,null,null,and the moment she appeared on the other side
18,null,null,the puppy made another rush at the stick
19,null,null,and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it
20,null,null,then Alice
21,null,null,thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart horse
22,null,null,and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet
23,null,null,ran round the thistle again
24,null,null,then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick
25,null,null,running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back
26,null,null,and barking hoarsely all the while
27,null,null,till at last it sat down a good way off
28,null,null,panting
29,null,null,with its tongue hanging out of its mouth
30,null,null,and its great eyes half shut .
2054 24
 (17, 17),
1,null,null,Well
2,null,null,perhaps you have n't found it so yet
3,null,null,' said Alice
4,null,null,but when you have to turn into a chrysalis you will some day
5,null,null,you know and then after that into a butterfly
6,null,null,I should think youll feel it a little queer
7,null,null,wont you
8,null,null,' Not a bit
9,null,null,' said the Caterpillar Well
10,null,null,perhaps your feelings may be different
11,null,null,' said Alice
12,null,null,all I know is
13,null,null,it would feel very queer to ME
14,null,null,You
15,null,null,' said the Caterpillar contemptuously Who are YOU
16,null,null,' Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation
17,anger,anger,ice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar 's making such VERY short remarks
18,null,null,and she drew herself up and said
19,null,null,very gravely
20,null,null,I think
21,null,null,you ought to tell me who YOU are
22,null,null,first
23,null,null,Why
24,null,null,' said the Caterpillar .
2055 37
 (18, 18),
1,null,null,Well
2,null,null,i 've tried to say  "  HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE
3,null,null,"   but it all came different
4,null,null,' Alice replied in a very melancholy voice
5,null,null,repeat
6,null,null,"  YOU ARE OLD
7,null,null,FATHER WILLIAM
8,null,null,"  ' said the Caterpillar  .  Alice folded her hands
9,null,null,and began :  You are old
10,null,null,Father William
11,null,null,' the young man said
12,null,null,And your hair has become very white
13,null,null,And yet you incessantly stand on your head  Do you think
14,null,null,at your age
15,null,null,it is right
16,null,null,'  In my youth
17,null,null,' Father William replied to his son
18,fear,fear,I feared it might injure the brain
19,null,null,But
20,null,null,now that im perfectly sure I have none
21,null,null,Why
22,null,null,I do it again and again
23,null,null,You are old
24,null,null,' said the youth
25,null,null,as I mentioned before
26,null,null,And have grown most uncommonly fat
27,null,null,Yet you turned a back somersault in at the door  Pray
28,null,null,what is the reason of that
29,null,null,'  In my youth
30,null,null,' said the sage
31,null,null,as he shook his grey locks
32,null,null,I kept all my limbs very supple By the use of this ointment one shilling the box  Allow me to sell you a couple
33,null,null,'  You are old
34,null,null,' said the youth
35,null,null,and your jaws are too weak For anything tougher than suet
36,null,null,Yet you finished the goose
37,null,null,with the bones and the beak  Pray how did you manage to do it
2056 23
 (10, 9),(10, 10),
1,null,null,Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute
2,null,null,trying to make out which were the two sides of it
3,null,null,and as it was perfectly round
4,null,null,she found this a very difficult question  .  However
5,null,null,at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go
6,null,null,and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand
7,null,null,nd now which is which
8,null,null,' she said to herself
9,null,fear,and nibbled a little of the right-hand bit to try the effect :  the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin :  it had struck her foot
10,fear,fear,She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change
11,null,null,but she felt that there was no time to be lost
12,null,null,as she was shrinking rapidly
13,null,null,so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit . Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot
14,null,null,that there was hardly room to open her mouth
15,null,null,but she did it at last
16,null,null,and managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit Come
17,null,null,my head 's free at last
18,null,null,' said Alice in a tone of delight
19,null,null,which changed into alarm in another moment
20,null,null,when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found :  all she could see
21,null,null,when she looked down
22,null,null,was an immense length of neck
23,null,null,which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her

2,null,null,'  Serpent
3,null,null,I say again

5,null,null,but in a more subdued tone
6,null,null,and added with a kind of sob
7,null,null,i 've tried every way
8,null,null,and nothing seems to suit them
9,null,null,'  I have n't the least idea what you 're talking about

11,null,null,'ve tried the roots of trees
12,null,null,and i 've tried banks
13,null,null,and i 've tried hedges
14,null,null,' the Pigeon went on
15,null,null,without attending to her
16,null,null,but those serpents
17,null,null,There 's no pleasing them
18,null,null,' Alice was more and more puzzled
19,null,null,but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished As if it wasnt trouble enough hatching the eggs
20,null,null,' said the Pigeon
21,null,null,but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day
22,null,null,Why

24,disgust,annoyed,' im very sorry you 've been annoyed
25,null,null,' said Alice
26,null,null,who was beginning to see its meaning And just as i 'd taken the highest tree in the wood
27,null,null,' continued the Pigeon
28,null,null,raising its voice to a shriek
29,null,null,and just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last
30,null,null,they must needs come wriggling down from the sky
31,null,null,Ugh

2,null,null,the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire
3,null,null,and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby  the fire irons came first
4,null,null,then followed a shower of saucepans
5,null,null,plates
6,null,null,and dishes  .  The Duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her
7,null,null,and the baby was howling so much already
8,null,null,that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not
9,null,null,PLEASE mind what you 're doing

11,null,null,jumping up and down in an agony of terror Oh
12,null,null,there goes his PRECIOUS nose '
13,null,null,as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it
14,null,null,and very nearly carried it off

17,null,null,the world would go round a deal faster than it does

10,null,null,who felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge Just think of what work it would make with the day and night
11,null,null,You see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis ' Talking of axes
12,null,null,' said the Duchess
13,null,fear,chop off her head
14,fear,anxiously,' Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook
15,null,null,to see if she meant to take the hint
16,null,null,but the cook was busily stirring the soup
17,null,null,and seemed not to be listening
18,null,null,so she went on again :   Twenty-four hours
19,null,null,I THINK
20,null,null,or is it twelve
21,null,null,I ' Oh
22,null,null,dont bother ME

25,null,null,' And with that she began nursing her child again
26,null,null,singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so
27,null,null,and giving it a violent shake at the end of every line :   Speak roughly to your little boy
28,null,null,And beat him when he sneezes :  He only does it to annoy
29,null,null,Because he knows it teases . '

3,null,null,as politely as she could The Dormouse is asleep again
4,null,null,' said the Hatter
5,disgust,disgust,and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose  .  The Dormouse shook its head impatiently
6,null,null,and said

8,null,null,Of course
9,null,null,of course
10,null,null,just what I was going to remark myself
11,null,null,Have you guessed the riddle yet

13,null,null,turning to Alice again No
14,null,null,I give it up
15,null,null,' Alice replied :   what 's the answer
16,null,null,'  I have n't the slightest idea
17,null,null,' said the Hatter Nor I
18,null,null,' said the March Hare
2061 31

1,null,null,Would you tell me
2,null,null,' said Alice
3,null,null,a little timidly
4,null,null,why you are painting those roses
5,null,null,' Five and Seven said nothing
6,null,null,but looked at Two  .  Two began in a low voice
7,null,null,Why the fact is
8,null,null,you see
9,null,null,Miss
10,null,null,this here ought to have been a RED rose tree
11,null,null,and we put a white one in by mistake
12,null,fear,and if the Queen was to find it out
13,null,fear,we should all have our heads cut off

15,null,null,you see

20,fear,anxiously,who had been anxiously looking across the garden
21,null,null,called out  The Queen
22,null,null,The Queen
23,null,null,' and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces  .  There was a sound of many footsteps
24,null,null,and Alice looked round
25,null,null,eager to see the Queen  .  First came ten soldiers carrying clubs
26,null,null,these were all shaped like the three gardeners
27,null,null,oblong and flat
28,null,null,with their hands and feet at the corners :  next the ten courtiers
29,null,null,these were ornamented all over with diamonds
30,null,null,and walked two and two
31,null,null,as the soldiers did
2062 41
 (29, 29),
1,null,null,Idiot
2,null,null,' said the Queen
3,null,null,tossing her head impatiently
4,null,null,and
5,null,null,turning to Alice
6,null,null,she went on
7,null,null,What 's your name
8,null,null,child
9,null,null,'  My name is Alice
10,null,null,so please your Majesty
11,null,null,' said Alice very politely
12,null,null,but she added
13,null,null,to herself
14,null,null,Why
15,null,null,theyre only a pack of cards
16,null,null,after allI need n't be afraid of them
17,null,null,'  And who are THESE
18,null,null,' said the Queen
19,null,null,pointing to the three gardeners who were lying round the rose tree
20,null,null,for
21,null,null,you see
22,null,null,as they were lying on their faces
23,null,null,and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack
24,null,null,she could not tell whether they were gardeners
25,null,null,or soldiers
26,null,null,or courtiers
27,null,null,or three of her own children How should I know
28,null,null,' said Alice
29,surprise,surprise,surprised at her own courage It 's no business of MINE
30,null,null,The Queen turned crimson with fury
31,null,null,and
32,null,null,after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast
33,null,null,screamed  Off with her head
34,null,null,Off '  Nonsense
35,null,null,' said Alice
36,null,null,very loudly and decidedly
37,null,null,and the Queen was silent  .  The King laid his hand upon her arm
38,null,null,and timidly said  Consider
39,null,null,my dear :  she is only a child
40,null,null,' The Queen turned angrily away from him
41,null,null,and said to the Knave  Turn them over
2063 18
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,I said  "  What for
2,null,null,"  '  She boxed the Queen 's ears ' the Rabbit began . Alice gave a little scream of laughter Oh
3,null,null,hush
4,fear,fear,' the Rabbit whispered in a frightened tone The Queen will hear you
5,null,null,You see
6,null,null,she came rather late
7,null,null,and the Queen said '  Get to your places
8,null,null,' shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder
9,null,null,and people began running about in all directions
10,null,null,tumbling up against each other
11,null,null,however
12,null,null,they got settled down in a minute or two
13,null,null,and the game began . Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet ground in her life
14,null,null,it was all ridges and furrows
15,null,null,the balls were live hedgehogs
16,null,null,the mallets live flamingoes
17,null,null,and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet
18,null,null,to make the arches
2064 19
 (9, 9),
1,null,null,By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back
2,null,null,the fight was over
3,null,null,and both the hedgehogs were out of sight :   but it does n't matter much
4,null,null,' thought Alice
5,null,null,as all the arches are gone from this side of the ground
6,null,null,So she tucked it away under her arm
7,null,null,that it might not escape again
8,null,null,and went back for a little more conversation with her friend  .  When she got back to the Cheshire Cat
9,surprise,surprise,she was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it :  there was a dispute going on between the executioner
10,null,null,the King
11,null,null,and the Queen
12,null,null,who were all talking at once
13,null,null,while all the rest were quite silent
14,null,null,and looked very uncomfortable The moment Alice appeared
15,null,null,she was appealed to by all three to settle the question
16,null,null,and they repeated their arguments to her
17,null,null,though
18,null,null,as they all spoke at once
19,null,null,she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said
2065 18
 (9, 10),(9, 13),
1,null,null,Thinking again
2,null,null,' the Duchess asked
3,null,null,with another dig of her sharp little chin i 've a right to think
4,null,null,' said Alice sharply
5,null,null,for she was beginning to feel a little worried Just about as much right
6,null,null,' said the Duchess
7,null,null,as pigs have to fly
8,null,null,and the m ' But here
9,surprise,to Alice 's great surprise,to Alice 's great surprise
10,null,surprise,the Duchess 's voice died away
11,null,null,even in the middle of her favourite word  moral
12,null,null,' and the arm that was linked into hers began to tremble . Alice looked up
13,null,surprise,and there stood the Queen in front of them
14,null,null,with her arms folded
15,null,null,frowning like a thunderstorm A fine day
16,null,null,your Majesty
17,null,null,' the Duchess began in a low
18,null,null,weak voice
2066 19
 (14, 8),(14, 9),
1,null,null,A fine day
2,null,null,your Majesty
3,null,null,' the Duchess began in a low
4,null,null,weak voice Now
5,null,null,I give you fair warning
6,null,null,' shouted the Queen
7,null,null,stamping on the ground as she spoke
8,null,fear,either you or your head must be off
9,null,fear,and that in about half no time
10,null,null,Take your choice
11,null,null,' The Duchess took her choice
12,null,null,and was gone in a moment Let 's go on with the game
13,null,null,' the Queen said to Alice
14,fear,frightened,and Alice was too much frightened to say a word
15,null,null,but slowly followed her back to the croquet ground . The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen 's absence
16,null,null,and were resting in the shade :  however
17,null,null,the moment they saw her
18,null,null,they hurried back to the game
19,null,null,the Queen merely remarking that a moment 's delay would cost them their lives
2067 24
 (16, 16),
1,null,null,I dont even know what a Mock Turtle is
2,null,null,It 's the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from
3,null,null,' said the Queen I never saw one
4,null,null,or heard of one
5,null,null,' said Alice Come on
6,null,null,then
7,null,null,' said the Queen
8,null,null,and he shall tell you his history
9,null,null,' As they walked off together
10,null,null,Alice heard the King say in a low voice
11,null,null,to the company generally
12,null,null,You are all pardoned
13,null,null,Come
14,null,null,THAT 's a good thing
15,null,null,' she said to herself
16,sadness,sadness,for she had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered
17,null,null,ey very soon came upon a Gryphon
18,null,null,lying fast asleep in the sun ( IF you dont know what a Gryphon is
19,null,null,look at the picture
20,null,null,Up
21,null,null,lazy thing
22,null,null,' said the Queen
23,null,null,and take this young lady to see the Mock Turtle
24,null,null,and to hear his history
2068 20
 (9, 9),
1,null,null,When we were little
2,null,null,' the Mock Turtle went on at last
3,null,null,more calmly
4,null,null,though still sobbing a little now and then
5,null,null,we went to school in the sea . The master was an old Turtle we used to call him Tortoise '  Why did you call him Tortoise
6,null,null,if he wasnt one
7,null,null,' Alice asked We called him Tortoise because he taught us
8,null,null,' said the Mock Turtle angrily :   really you are very dull
9,sadness,sadness,'  You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question
10,null,null,' added the Gryphon
11,null,null,and then they both sat silent and looked at poor Alice
12,null,null,who felt ready to sink into the earth . At last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle
13,null,null,Drive on
14,null,null,old fellow
15,null,null,dont be all day about it
16,null,null,' and he went on in these words :   Yes
17,null,null,we went to school in the sea
18,null,null,though you may n't believe it '  I never said I didnt
19,null,null,' interrupted Alice You did
20,null,null,' said the Mock Turtle
2069 26
 (19, 17),
1,null,null,theyre done with blacking
2,null,null,I believe
3,null,null,Boots and shoes under the sea
4,null,null,' the Gryphon went on in a deep voice
5,null,null,are done with a whiting . Now you know
6,null,null,And what are they made of
7,null,null,' Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity Soles and eels
8,null,null,of course
9,null,null,' the Gryphon replied rather impatiently :   any shrimp could have told you that
10,null,null,If i 'd been the whiting
11,null,null,' said Alice
12,null,null,whose thoughts were still running on the song
13,null,null,i 'd have said to the porpoise
14,null,null,"  Keep back
15,null,null,please :  we dont want YOU with us
16,null,null,"  '  They were obliged to have him with them
17,null,surprise,' the Mock Turtle said :   no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise
18,null,null,would n't it really
19,surprise,in a tone of great surprise,' said Alice in a tone of great surprise Of course not
20,null,null,' said the Mock Turtle :   why
21,null,null,if a fish came to ME
22,null,null,and told me he was going a journey
23,null,null,I should say  "  With what porpoise
24,null,null,"  '  dont you mean  "  purpose "
25,null,null,' said Alice I mean what I say
26,null,null,' the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone
2070 23
 (11, 11),
1,null,null,And the Gryphon added  Come
2,null,null,let 's hear some of YOUR adventures
3,null,null,I could tell you my adventures beginning from this morning
4,null,null,' said Alice a little timidly :   but it 's no use going back to yesterday
5,null,null,because I was a different person then
6,null,null,Explain all that
7,null,null,' said the Mock Turtle No
8,null,null,no
9,null,null,The adventures first
10,null,null,' said the Gryphon in an impatient tone :   explanations take such a dreadful time
11,fear,fear,So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the White Rabbit She was a little nervous about it just at first
12,null,null,the two creatures got so close to her
13,null,null,one on each side
14,null,null,and opened their eyes and mouths so VERY wide
15,null,null,but she gained courage as she went on . Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about her repeating  YOU ARE OLD
16,null,null,FATHER WILLIAM
17,null,null,' to the Caterpillar
18,null,null,and the words all coming different
19,null,null,and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath
20,null,null,and said  That 's very curious
21,null,null,It 's all about as curious as it can be
22,null,null,' said the Gryphon It all came different
23,null,null,' the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully
2071 28
 (8, 6),(8, 7),
1,null,null,Off with her head
2,null,null,' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice . Nobody moved Who cares for you
3,null,null,' said Alice
4,null,null,( she had grown to her full size by this time
5,null,null,you 're nothing but a pack of cards
6,null,fear,' At this the whole pack rose up into the air
7,null,fear,and came flying down upon her :  she gave a little scream
8,fear,half of fright and half of anger,half of fright and half of anger
9,null,null,and tried to beat them off
10,null,null,and found herself lying on the bank
11,null,null,with her head in the lap of her sister
12,null,null,who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face Wake up
13,null,null,Alice dear
14,null,null,' said her sister
15,null,null,Why
16,null,null,what a long sleep you 've had
17,null,null,'  Oh
18,null,null,i 've had such a curious dream
19,null,null,' said Alice
20,null,null,and she told her sister
21,null,null,as well as she could remember them
22,null,null,all these strange Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about
23,null,null,and when she had finished
24,null,null,her sister kissed her
25,null,null,and said
26,null,null,It WAS a curious dream
27,null,null,dear
28,null,null,certainly :  but now run in to your tea
2073 12
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Patrick 's face cleared
2,fear,fear,It was no grace or beauty that he feared in any stranger
3,null,null,but the sheer might and un right that their Regency enabled the House of Albany to exercise over the orphans of the royal family
4,null,null,whose head was absent
5,null,null,and a captive knight could be no mischievous person
6,null,null,Still this might be only a specious pretence to impose on the chaplain
7,null,null,and gain admittance to the castle
8,null,null,and Patrick was resolved to be well on his guard
9,null,null,though he replied courteously to the graceful bow with which the stranger greeted him
10,null,null,saying in a manly mellow voice and southern accent
11,null,null,' i have been bold enough to presume on the good father 's offer of hospitality
12,null,null,Sir . '
2074 4
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,' what should I see
2,null,null,Who is he like
3,null,null,' asked Patrick
4,surprise,surprise,surprised at his father 's manner .
2075 13
 (2, 1),
1,null,disgust,Lilias sat between her uncle and his guest
2,disgust,jealousy,looking so fair and bright that Patrick felt fresh accesses of angry jealousy
3,null,null,while the visitor talked as one able to report to the natives from another world
4,null,null,and that world the hateful England
5,null,null,which as a Scotsman he was bound to abhor
6,null,null,Had it been France
7,null,null,it had been endurable
8,null,null,but praise of English habits was mere disloyalty
9,null,null,and yet
10,null,null,whenever Patrick tried to throw in a disparaging word
11,null,null,he found himself met with a quiet superiority such as he had believed no knight in Scotland could assume with him
12,null,null,and still it was neither brow beating nor insolence
13,null,null,nothing that could give offence .
2076 12
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Patrick shrugged his shoulders
2,fear,fear,but Lilias was so anxious to hear the lay
3,null,null,that she entreated him to be silent
4,null,null,and Sir James
5,null,null,with a manly mellow voice
6,null,null,with an exceedingly sweet strain in it
7,null,null,and a skill
8,null,null,both of modulation and finger
9,null,null,such as showed admirable taste and instruction
10,null,null,poured forth that beautiful song of the nightingale at Windsor
11,null,null,which commences King James 's story of his love
12,null,null,in his poem of the King 's Quhair .
2077 23
 (12, 12),
1,null,null,There was an eager pressing round to hear
2,null,null,and not only were Lilias and Malcolm
3,null,null,but old Sir David himself
4,null,null,much affected by the strain
5,null,null,which the latter said put him in mind of the days of King Robert III
6,null,null,which
7,null,null,sad as they were
8,null,null,now seemed like good old times
9,null,null,so much worse was the present state of affairs
10,null,null,Sir James
11,null,null,however
12,fear,fear,seemed anxious to prevent discussion of the verses he had sung
13,null,null,and applied to Malcolm to give a specimen of his powers :   and thus
14,null,null,with music
15,null,null,ballad
16,null,null,and lay
17,null,null,the evening passed away
18,null,null,till the parting cup was sent round
19,null,null,and the Tutor of Glenuskie and Malcolm marshalled their guest to the apartment where he was to sleep
20,null,null,in a wainscoted box bedstead
21,null,null,and his two attendant squires
22,null,null,a great iron gray Scot and a rosy honest faced Englishman
23,null,null,on pallets on the floor .
2078 29
 (22, 22),
1,null,null,They were
2,null,null,in effect
3,null,null,riding somewhat carelessly
4,null,null,and with the ease of men whose feat was performed
5,null,null,and who expected no more opposition Full in the midst was Lilias
6,null,null,entirely muffled and pinioned by a large plaid drawn closely round her
7,null,null,and held upon the front of the saddle of a large tall horse
8,null,null,ridden by a slender
9,null,null,light limbed
10,null,null,wiry groom
11,null,null,whom Malcolm knew as Christopher Hall
12,null,null,a retainer of the Duke of Albany
13,null,null,and beside him rode her captor
14,null,null,Sir Walter Stewart
15,null,null,a man little above twenty
16,null,null,but with a bronzed
17,null,null,hardened
18,null,null,reckless expression that made him look much older
19,null,null,and of huge height and giant build . Malcolm knew him well
20,null,null,and regarded him with unmitigated horror and dread
21,null,null,both from the knowledge of his ruffianly violence even towards his father
22,fear,fear,from fear of his intentions
23,null,null,and from the misery that his brutal jests
24,null,null,scoffs
25,null,null,and practical jokes had often personally inflicted :   and the sight of his sister in the power of this wicked man was the realization of all his worst fears But ere there was time for more than one strong pang of consternation and constitutional terror
26,null,null,Sir James 's shout of  ' st andrew for the right
27,null,null,' was ringing out
28,null,null,echoed by all the fifteen in ambush with him
29,null,null,as simultaneously they leapt forward
2079 2
 (1, 1),
1,fear,fear,And for all Malcolm 's anxiety for his uncle
2,null,null,his heart had never given such a leap as at finding himself suddenly raised from the depressed down-trodden coward into something like manhood and self respect .
2080 27
 (25, 26),(25, 27),
1,null,null,' kinsman
2,null,null,' thought Malcolm
3,null,null,' do all wandering Stewarts claim kin to the blood royal
4,null,null,' but then
5,null,null,as he looked at Sir James 's stately head
6,null,null,he felt that no assumption could be unbecoming in one of such a presence
7,null,null,and so kind to himself
8,null,null,and
9,null,null,ashamed of the moment 's petulance
10,null,null,dismounted
11,null,null,and
12,null,null,as John said
13,null,null,' this is the way to our noon meat
14,null,null,' he let himself be conducted through the trees to a glade
15,null,null,sheltered from the wind
16,null,null,where a Lenten though not unsavoury meal of bread
17,null,null,dried fish
18,null,null,and eggs was laid out on the grass
19,null,null,in a bright warm sunshine
20,null,null,and Hal
21,null,null,declaring himself to have a hunter 's appetite
22,null,null,and that he knew Jamie had been starved in Scotland
23,null,null,and was as lean as a greyhound
24,null,null,seated himself on the grass
25,surprise,surprise,and to Malcolm 's extreme surprise
26,null,surprise,not to say disgust
27,null,surprise,was served by Lord Marmion on the knee and with doffed cap .
2081 13
 (12, 12),
1,null,null,He was glad that his own Sir James was equal in dignity
2,null,null,as well as superior in height
3,null,null,and he thought the terrible red lightning of those auburn eyes would be impossible to the sparkling azure eyes of the Englishman
4,null,null,steadfast
5,null,null,keen
6,null,null,and brilliant unspeakably though they were
7,null,null,but so soon as Sir James seemed to have made his explanation
8,null,null,the look was most winningly turned on him
9,null,null,a hand held out
10,null,null,and he was thus greeted :   ' welcome
11,null,null,my young Prince Malcolm
12,happiness,happiness,I am happy that your cousin thinks so well of our cheer
13,null,null,that he has brought you to partake it . '
2082 20
 (20, 19),
1,null,null,A courier rode up at the moment
2,null,null,and presented some letters
3,null,null,which Sir Harry at once opened and read
4,null,null,beckoning his brother and Sir James to his side
5,null,null,while Malcolm rode on in their wake
6,null,null,in a state of dismay and bewilderment
7,null,null,Nigel and Lord Marmion were together at so great an interval that he could not fall back on them
8,null,null,nor learn from them who these brothers were
9,null,null,And there was something in the ironical suppressed pity with which Harry had spoken of his prospects with the King of Scots
10,null,null,that terrified him all the more
11,null,null,because he knew that Sir James and Nigel would both hold it unworthy of him to have spoken freely of his own sovereign with an Englishman
12,null,null,Would James be another Walter
13,null,null,and
14,null,null,if so
15,null,null,would Sir James Stewart protect him
16,null,null,He had acquired much affection for
17,null,null,and strong reliance on
18,null,null,the knight
19,null,sadness,but there was something unexplained
20,sadness,hear sank,and his hear sank .

 (7, 7),
1,null,null,Malcolm felt as averse as did the French princesses to burgher wealth and splendour
2,null,null,and his mind had not opened to understand burgher worth and weight
3,null,null,and when he saw the princes John and Humfrey
4,null,null,and even his own king
5,null,null,seeking out city dames and accosting them with friendly looks
6,null,null,it seemed to him a degrading truckling to riches
7,fear,fear,from which he was anxious to save his future queen
8,null,null,but when he would have offered his arm to Lady Joan
9,null,null,he saw her already being led away by an alderman measuring at least a yard across the shoulders
10,null,null,and the good natured Earl of March
11,null,null,seeing him at a loss
12,null,null,presented him to a round merry wife in a scarlet petticoat and black boddice
13,null,null,its plump curves wreathed with geld chains
14,null,null,who began pitying him for having been sent to the wars so young
15,null,null,being
16,null,null,as usual
17,null,null,charmed into pity by his soft appealing eyes and unconscious grace
18,null,null,would not believe his assertions that he was neither a captive nor a Frenchman

20,null,null,when he spoke like a stranger
21,null,null,and halted from a wound . '
2091 19
 (19, 19),
1,null,null,He had shot up suddenly to a fair height
2,null,null,had almost lost his lameness
3,null,null,and gained much more appearance of health and power of enduring fatigue
4,null,null,His nerves had become less painfully sensitive
5,null,null,and when after his first skirmish
6,null,null,during which he had kept close to King James
7,null,null,far too much terrified to stir an inch from him
8,null,null,he had not only found himself perfectly safe
9,null,null,but had been much praised for his valour
10,null,null,he had been so much pleased with himself that he quite wished for another occasion of displaying his bravery
11,null,null,and
12,null,null,what with use
13,null,null,and what with the increasing spirit of pugnacity
14,null,null,he was as sincere as Ralf Percy in abusing the French for never coming to a pitched battle
15,null,null,Perhaps
16,null,null,indeed
17,null,null,Malcolm spoke even more eagerly than Ralf
18,null,null,in his own surprise and gratification at finding himself no coward

6,null,null,when absolutely committed to his charge
7,null,null,For the present
8,null,null,there was no fear of the prisoner being summarily executed by any lawful authority
9,null,null,since the King had promised to take cognizance of the case
10,null,null,and the chief danger was from his chance discovery by some lawless man-at-arms
11,null,null,who would think himself doing good service by killing a concealed Scot under any circumstances .

14,null,null,Might he not say it was the part of Walter Stewart over again
15,null,null,Indeed
16,null,null,Malcolm remembered how carefully King James was prevented from hearing the means by which the Countess intended to make the lady his own
17,null,null,and a sensation came over him
18,null,null,that it was profanation to call on St
19,null,null,Andrew to bless what was to be brought about by such means
20,null,null,Why was it that
21,null,null,as his eyes fell on the face of King Henry
22,null,null,the whole world and all his projects acquired so different a colouring
