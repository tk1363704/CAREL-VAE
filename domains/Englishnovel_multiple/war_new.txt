4,null,null,but when he found two brothers contending
5,null,null,he withdrew it to show their conduct was wicked .  "
194 8
 (5, 6),
1,null,null,So the four sang
2,null,null,each in turn
3,null,null,and died in the sight of some who pitied
4,null,null,and some who feared
5,anger,hated,and some who hated
6,null,anger,for the sake of land and women
7,null,null,So the four went beyond the power of gold and gewgaw
8,null,null,and were dragged in the mire around the walls and flung into the yellow waters of the river .
222 8
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,To see the strange places of the world
2,null,null,and the stranger people
3,null,null,to become a man of wealth and influence such as Monsieur Vigo
4,fear,fear,and ( I fear I loved it best ) to match my brains with others at a bargain
5,null,null,I turned it all over slowly
6,null,null,gravely
7,null,null,in my boyish mind
8,null,null,rubbing the hard dirt on the floor with the toe of my moccasin .
238 10
 (3, 9),
1,null,null,Fortunat 's address must be there
2,null,null,so she asked and obtained permission to examine this notebook
3,happiness,to her great joy,and to her great joy
4,null,null,under the letter  "  F
5,null,null,"   she found the entry :   "  Fortunat ( Isidore )

9,null,happiness,im sure that I shall find Pascal now
10,null,null,"   she exclaimed .

 (1, 1),
1,fear,fear,It was easy to see by Madame de Fondege 's earnestness that she feared Mademoiselle Marguerite would avail herself of this opportunity of recovering her liberty
2,null,null,"  What shall I do
3,null,null,then
4,null,null,"   asked the girl .
247 6
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,He was in all the greater haste as it was Sunday
2,null,null,Fortunat was in the habit of passing these days in the country
3,fear,fear,and Chupin feared he might fail to see him if he was not expeditious in his movements
4,null,null,And while running to the Place de la Bourse
5,null,null,he carefully prepared the story he meant to relate
6,null,null,deeply impressed by the wisdom of the popular maxim which says :   "  It is not always well to tell the whole truth .  "
250 3
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,What if he knew that there 's a fortune waiting for a claimant
2,surprise,surprise,I should n't at all be surprised if I found that he wanted to cook his bread in our oven
3,null,null,But father Fortunat would n't be pleased with the news .
255 6
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Having come with the intention of offering his agent a handsome sum
2,surprise,surprise,he was agreeably surprised to find that Chupin 's scruples would enable him to save his money
3,null,null,"  If I had not found you engaged in study
4,null,null,Victor
5,null,null,"   he said
6,null,null,"  I should have thought you had been drinking .
256 6
 (2, 3),
1,null,null,Fortunat was amazed
2,anger,annoyed,and at the same time much annoyed
3,null,anger,to find himself forsaken on account of such a trifle
4,null,null,He feared
5,null,null,too
6,null,null,that Chupin might let his tongue wag if he left his employment .

5,null,null,too
6,null,fear,that Chupin might let his tongue wag if he left his employment
7,null,null,So
8,null,null,since he had confided this project to Chupin
9,null,null,he was determined that Chupin alone should carry it into execution .
258 6
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,If any one heard them
2,null,null,no one came
3,null,null,still they recalled Pascal to a sense of the situation
4,sadness,sadness,and he was ashamed of his violence
5,null,null,He released Madame Leon
6,null,null,and his manner suddenly became as humble as it had been threatening .

1,null,null,"  Crazy in the fullest sense of the word
2,fear,fear,She refuses the count 's millions from a silly fear of telling people that she belongs to the Chalusse family
3,null,null,She threatened her brother
4,null,null,but she would never have carried her threats into execution .
267 6
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,There was but one certain and positive thing
2,null,null,and this was that the money he had counted upon had escaped him
3,null,null,and he experienced as acute a pang as if he had lost forty thousand francs a second time
4,null,null,Perhaps
5,null,null,at that moment
6,sadness,sadness,he was sorry that he had severed his connection with the marquis .

 (7, 7),
1,null,null,Like a dutiful son

6,null,null,I am sure
7,happiness,happiness,I am delighted to find you
8,null,null,In fact
9,null,null,I came to town for that purpose
389 10
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,Their faces were pale and sad
2,null,null,and there were tears in the eyes of some of them
3,null,null,What was passing in their minds
4,fear,fear,Perhaps they were overcome by that unconquerable fear which sudden and unexpected death always provokes
5,null,null,Perhaps they unconsciously loved this master
6,null,null,whose bread they ate
7,null,null,Perhaps their grief was only selfishness
8,null,null,and they were merely wondering what would become of them
9,null,null,where they should find another situation
10,null,null,and if it would prove a good one .
393 11
 (6, 7),
1,null,null,but I was wrong
2,null,null,for in the afternoon he sent a message
3,null,null,through Madame Leon
4,null,null,requesting me to join him in the garden
5,null,null,I hastened there
6,surprise,surprised,very much surprised
7,null,surprise,for the weather was extremely disagreeable
8,null,null,' dear Marguerite
9,null,null,' he said
10,null,null,on seeing me
11,null,null,' help me to find the fragments of that letter which I flung from the window this morning .
394 5
 (4, 5),
1,null,null,"  I was much grieved at the count 's disappointment
2,null,null,"   continued Mademoiselle Marguerite
3,null,null,"  but suddenly he exclaimed
4,happiness,joyfully :,joyfully :  ' that address why
5,null,happiness,such a person will give it to me what a fool I am
399 7
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,As a rule
2,null,null,Chupin was not easily impressed
3,fear,fear,but he felt almost frightened by his employer 's agitation
4,null,null,"  I only repeated what M
5,null,null,Casimir told me
6,null,null,monsieur
7,null,null,"   was his reply .
403 11
 (7, 10),
1,null,null,Fortunat 's countenance wore an expression of profound commiseration
2,null,null,A looker on would have supposed him interested and sympathetic to the last degree
3,null,null,but in reality
4,null,null,he was furious
5,null,null,Time was passing
6,null,null,and the conversation was wandering farther and farther from the object of his visit
7,surprise,surprised,"  I am surprised
8,null,null,madame
9,null,null,"   said he
10,null,surprise,"  that you never applied to your former employer
11,null,null,the Count de Chalusse .  "
404 10
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,Isidore Fortunat was literally upon the rack
2,null,null,and to make his sufferings still more horrible
3,null,null,he dared not ask any direct question
4,null,null,nor allow his curiosity to become manifest
5,fear,fear,for fear of alarming the woman
6,null,null,"  Let me see
7,null,null,"   said he
8,null,null,"  I think I am sure that I have heard or that I have read I cannot say which some story about a Mademoiselle de Chalusse
9,null,null,It was something terrible
10,null,null,wasnt it
407 13
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,It was the old
2,null,null,sad story of a ruined girl paying for a moment 's madness with her happiness and all her after life
3,null,null,A terrible drama
4,null,null,no doubt
5,null,null,but one that is of such frequent occurrence that it seems as commonplace as life itself
6,null,null,Thus any one who was acquainted with M
7,surprise,surprise,Isidore Fortunat would have been surprised to see how greatly he was moved by such a trifle
8,null,null,"  Poor girl
9,null,null,"   said he
10,null,null,in view of saying something
11,null,null,And then
12,null,null,in a tone of assumed carelessness
13,null,null,he inquired :    "  Did they never discover what scoundrel carried Mademoiselle de Chalusse away
408 16
 (11, 11),
1,null,null,You could not say that M
2,null,null,Fortunat was angry
3,null,null,Such a man
4,null,null,as cold and as smooth as a hundred franc piece
5,null,null,has no useless passions
6,null,null,But he was intensely irritated to hear his client foolishly chanting the paeons of victory
7,null,null,while he was compelled to conceal his grief at the loss of his forty thousand francs
8,null,null,deep in the recesses of his heart
9,null,null,So
10,null,null,far from being touched by the marquis 's evident alarm
11,happiness,happiness,it pleased him to be able to turn the dagger in the wound he had just inflicted
12,null,null,"  You must excuse my incredulity
13,null,null,"   said he
14,null,null,"  It comes entirely from something you
15,null,null,yourself
16,null,null,told me about a week ago .  "
409 12
 (3, 2),
1,null,null,de Valorsay paced the floor in a state of intense agitation
2,null,fear,Had he caught a glimpse of his own face in the looking-glass
3,fear,frightened,it would have frightened him

8,null,null,That word is in everybody 's mouth
9,null,null,nowadays

11,null,null,what do you understand by a gentleman
12,null,null,Mons .
410 9
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,Fortunat would certainly have preferred to lose a good pound of flesh rather than the sum of money mentioned
2,null,null,but
3,null,null,on the other hand
4,null,null,he felt that it would not do for him to sever his connection with his client until the death of the Count de Chalusse was certain
5,fear,fear,and being anxious to save his money and to keep his client
6,null,null,his embarrassment was extreme
7,null,null,"  It was the most unfortunate thing in the world
8,null,null,"   he stammered
9,null,null,"  I apprehended no difficulty whatever  "
412 8
 (8, 6),(8, 7),
1,null,null,Fortunat 's embarrassment was really painful to witness
2,null,null,He was not usually wanting in courage
3,null,null,but the events of the evening had shaken his confidence and his composure
4,null,null,The hope of gain and the fear of loss had deprived him of his wanted clearness of mind
5,null,null,Feeling that he had just committed a terrible blunder
6,null,sadness,he racked his brain to find some way of repairing it
7,null,sadness,and finding none
8,sadness,confusion,his confusion increased .
413 14
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,He took them
2,null,null,without even asking the mother if she had enough left to purchase her dinner that evening
3,null,null,and the fine gentleman
4,null,null,who had won and pocketed Jules Chazel 's stolen gold
5,null,null,thought the banker 's conduct perfectly natural and just
6,null,null,It is true that Madame d' argeles was in despair during forty-eight hours or so
7,null,null,for the police had begun a sort of investigation
8,fear,fear,and she feared this might frighten her visitors and empty her drawing-room
9,null,null,Not at all
10,null,null,however
11,null,null,on the contrary
12,null,null,she had good cause to congratulate herself upon the notoriety she gained through this suicide
13,null,null,For five days she was the talk of Paris
14,null,null,and Alfred d' aunay even published her portrait in the Illustrated Chronicle .
415 15
 (11, 11),
1,null,null,The table itself was adorned with a rich tapestry cover
2,null,null,but this was visible only at the corners

4,null,null,in turn
5,null,null,with a green baize cloth considerably the worse for wear
6,null,null,Madame d' argeles 's guests were probably not over fifty in number
7,null,null,but they all seemed to belong to the very best society
8,null,null,The majority of them were men of forty or thereabouts
9,null,null,several wore decorations
10,null,null,and two or three of the eldest were treated with marked deference
11,surprise,surprise,Certain well-known names which Pascal overheard surprised him greatly
12,null,null,"  What
13,null,null,these men here
14,null,null,"   he said to himself

416 8
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,A score of persons were seated at the card table
2,null,null,and the guests who had retired into the adjoining salon were silently watching the progress of the game
3,null,null,or quietly chatting in the corners of the room
4,surprise,surprise,It surprised him to note that every one spoke in very low tones
5,null,null,there was something very like respect
6,null,null,even awe
7,null,null,in this subdued murmur
8,null,null,One might have supposed that those present were celebrating the rites of some mysterious worship .

3,null,null,never fail to produce an effect diametrically opposed to that which they seemingly aim at
4,null,null,de Coralth 's persistence
5,null,null,and the importance he attached to a mere trifle
6,null,null,could not fail to annoy the most patient man in the world
7,anger,anger,and in fact his patronizing tone really irritated Pascal
8,null,null,"  You are free

1,null,null,However the game proceeded
2,null,null,but no one paid any attention to it
3,null,null,The stakes were insignificant
4,null,null,and loss or gain drew no exclamation from any one
5,null,sadness,The attention of the entire party was concentrated on Pascal
6,null,null,and he
7,sadness,with despair in his heart,with despair in his heart
8,null,null,followed the movements of the cards
9,null,null,which were passing from hand to hand
10,null,null,and fast approaching him again
11,null,null,When they reached him the silence became breathless
