3	null	null	That is a long flight . You had a layover too , is that right ? You must be tired .
4	null	null	Actually I feel quite rested . I was able to sleep on the plane .
5	happiness	null	Good ! Here , let me help you with your bag . Is it your first time to Seattle ? I'd be happy to take you around this city and show you the sights tonight if you're up to it .

2	null	null	Oh , my dear lady . Take it easy . You should forgive a green hand like him .
3	anger	null	He does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy .
4	null	null	I suggest you talk with him and teach him how to deal with the problems .
5	anger	null	I have told him how to do it several times , but he's never listened to me .
6	null	null	Maybe you should communicate with him just like a friend and not a boss .
7	anger	null	Oh , I always have difficulty in getting along with the staff .
8	null	null	Just take them for your good friends and have a talk with them as we do , make sure you don't lose your temper .
9	disgust	null	I think that's a bad idea . I'd hate anyone here to think of me as a friend . How would they ever respect me as they can do whatever they want ?

2	null	null	I feel kind of stupid .
3	null	null	Why ?
4	null	null	We got lost coming back . I guess I don't really know this town yet .
5	surprise	null	You got lost . You're kidding !
6	null	null	No . We took a wrong turn somewhere . And Joseph doesn't know the town at all . So I started giving him directions . But I didn't really know where we were . So we got seriously lost .
7	null	null	You could have called .
8	null	null	I know I could have . But finally we asked someone where we were .
9	surprise	null	You've been gone for two hours . How could you get lost for so long ?
10	null	null	Guess where we ended up .
11	null	null	I don't know . Where ?
12	null	null	When we finally decided to ask someone , they told us we were in Grangerfield .
13	surprise	null	Grangerfield ! You were in Grangerfield ? That's a completely different town ! How could you drive to a completely different town ?
14	null	null	I don't know . The person we asked had to give us directions to the highway to get back here .
15	null	null	Grangerfield is like a dozen miles away from here .
16	null	null	I know it is . I don't know how it happened .
17	null	null	Hmm , maybe I do .
18	null	null	What ?
19	null	null	Maybe I have an idea how it happened .
20	null	null	How ?

4	null	null	Blackout ? Even the TV has the limit .
5	null	null	Don't you know you will look like a monster in the blackout ?
6	anger	null	Oops , no , Daddy can't watch American Idol , either !
7	null	null	That's not the point . Come on , can you imagine that there will be no electricity on such a hot day ?
8	fear	null	Oh , my god ! No air-conditioner !
9	null	null	OK , since you are the smart one , can you come up with a better plan ? So that we won't be baked like cookies here .
10	null	null	How about playing Barbie out there in the neighborhood ?
11	null	null	Barbie ? You know , I might be seven , but I'm not a girl .

5	null	null	Sounds quite fruitful , why do you call it still a nightmare then ?
6	sadness	null	Well , the air line lost my luggage on the return flight and then I lost my carry on bag when I was tackling with the officers in charge . I left the airport three hours later than I expected and then I was caught in a traffic jam . When I finally got home , I was totally exhausted . But I found the elevator was out of service due to a blackout .

3	anger	null	I know . This is terrible . What can we do ? This snow doesn't stop falling !
4	null	null	I told you we should have stayed in town today . The weather report said 100 percent chance of snow . Why did you want to come up here ?
5	null	null	I wanted to show you the cabin . We only had another half-hour to go .
6	null	null	Well , now we're stuck . What can we do ?
7	null	null	I don't know .
8	null	null	I've heard that when this happens , it's important to save energy .
9	null	null	What do you mean ?
10	null	null	We're stranded here , Tom . We may be here a long time . We need to conserve the gas in the car . The car's energy is what will keep us warm .
11	null	null	I have plenty of gas .
12	null	null	Yes , but the gas and the battery both have to stay working . We can't just let the car run and run . If we do , it will die soon . Then we'll freeze .
13	null	null	So what can we do ?
14	null	null	Turn the lights off . Then , run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . That will conserve the heat as long as possible .
15	happiness	null	Alright . That's a good idea .
16	null	null	I wish we hadn't come up here . Now we'll probably be here for days .
17	null	null	Days ?

19	surprise	null	Oh , my God ! It's good we have food .

4	null	null	if he didn't have any drug problems , he would have won .
5	surprise	null	what ? What kind of drugs was he using ?
6	null	null	he was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster .
7	null	null	I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs .
8	null	null	they are . The reason why they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards .
9	null	null	that's so disappointing . I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs .
10	null	null	I don't think it's right , but I can understand why they might . Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country !
11	null	null	regardless of how much pressure you're under , there's never a good reason to take drugs .
12	null	null	I agree . Hopefully with the new regulations , fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs .
