2,6,-1,It was pretty bumpy , also a bit long , all together about 5 hours .
3,6,-1,That is a long flight . You had a layover too , is that right ? You must be tired .
4,6,-1,Actually I feel quite rested . I was able to sleep on the plane .
5,0,-1,Good ! Here , let me help you with your bag . Is it your first time to Seattle ? I'd be happy to take you around this city and show you the sights tonight if you're up to it .

2,6,-1,Oh , my dear lady . Take it easy . You should forgive a green hand like him .
3,5,-1,He does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy .
4,6,-1,I suggest you talk with him and teach him how to deal with the problems .
5,5,-1,I have told him how to do it several times , but he's never listened to me .
6,6,-1,Maybe you should communicate with him just like a friend and not a boss .
7,5,-1,Oh , I always have difficulty in getting along with the staff .
8,6,-1,Just take them for your good friends and have a talk with them as we do , make sure you don't lose your temper .
9,2,-1,I think that's a bad idea . I'd hate anyone here to think of me as a friend . How would they ever respect me as they can do whatever they want ?
10,6,-1,I disagree . All you have to do is respect the staff and their opinions .

 (1, 1),(5, 4),(9, 9),(13, 12),(13, 13),
1,0,-1,Well , I'm glad you're finally back . I was wondering what happened .
2,6,-1,I feel kind of stupid .
3,6,-1,Why ?
4,6,-1,We got lost coming back . I guess I don't really know this town yet .
5,3,-1,You got lost . You're kidding !
6,6,-1,No . We took a wrong turn somewhere . And Joseph doesn't know the town at all . So I started giving him directions . But I didn't really know where we were . So we got seriously lost .
7,6,-1,You could have called .
8,6,-1,I know I could have . But finally we asked someone where we were .
9,3,-1,You've been gone for two hours . How could you get lost for so long ?
10,6,-1,Guess where we ended up .
11,6,-1,I don't know . Where ?
12,6,-1,When we finally decided to ask someone , they told us we were in Grangerfield .
13,3,-1,Grangerfield ! You were in Grangerfield ? That's a completely different town ! How could you drive to a completely different town ?
14,6,-1,I don't know . The person we asked had to give us directions to the highway to get back here .
15,6,-1,Grangerfield is like a dozen miles away from here .
16,6,-1,I know it is . I don't know how it happened .
17,6,-1,Hmm , maybe I do .
18,6,-1,What ?
19,6,-1,Maybe I have an idea how it happened .
20,6,-1,How ?
21,6,-1,You were too busy looking at Joseph , and you weren't paying attention to the road .
22,6,-1,Oh , that's what you think , huh ?
64 13
 (6, 3),(6, 6),(8, 7),(8, 8),
1,5,-1,Oh , come on , Ultraman !
2,6,-1,What's up , Bro ? What's in the bulletin ?
3,6,-1,It says that there will be a blackout from 5 p . m . to 7 p . m . in our neighborhood today .
4,6,-1,Blackout ? Even the TV has the limit .
5,6,-1,Don't you know you will look like a monster in the blackout ?
6,5,-1,Oops , no , Daddy can't watch American Idol , either !
7,6,-1,That's not the point . Come on , can you imagine that there will be no electricity on such a hot day ?
8,4,-1,Oh , my god ! No air-conditioner !
9,6,-1,OK , since you are the smart one , can you come up with a better plan ? So that we won't be baked like cookies here .
10,6,-1,How about playing Barbie out there in the neighborhood ?
11,6,-1,Barbie ? You know , I might be seven , but I'm not a girl .
12,6,-1,Do you have a better plan ?
13,6,-1,All right , all right .

1,0,-1,Hey ! I just bought one of those new Japanese cell phones ! It's loaded with extras .
2,6,-1,What does it do ?
3,0,-1,It's got a built-in video camera so you can see the person you're talking to . It also takes stills and I can use the E-mail mode to send digital pictures straight to my friend's phone !
4,0,-1,Wow ! What else does it do ?
5,6,-1,I can plug it into a folding keyboard to type in message mode . l can even surf the net .
6,0,-1,Cool ! Anything else ?
7,6,-1,Yes . With the 600 - second digital memory , l can record my voice and send it using voice message mode .
8,0,-1,Wow !
9,0,-1,You'll love this ! I can use a stylus to draw a map on the touch screen and then use the fax mode to send it to another phone .

2,6,-1,They'll be ready by this afternoon .
3,3,-1,Oh , no ! I'm leaving for Japan at 11 this morning .
4,1,-1,Is that right ? We're very sorry .
5,6,-1,I thought it was " the same day " service . Anyway , please do hurry .
6,1,-1,I'm afraid we can't return it by 11 o'clock .
7,6,-1,Well , then , would you send it to Japan , please ?
8,6,-1,Yes , we'll do so .

 (1, 1),(3, 1),(3, 3),(5, 4),(5, 5),(7, 7),
1,1,-1,I'm very worried , doctor . I'm afraid that I'm very ill .
2,6,-1,Why do you think so ?
3,1,-1,Because I feel tired all the time , even when I wake up in the morning . I find it very difficult to do any work . I have no appetite .
4,6,-1,How do you sleep ?
5,1,-1,Very badly , doctor .
6,6,-1,Are you worried about anything ?
7,1,-1,Well , yes , I am . I'm worried about my work . I've just taken a new job . I earn a lot of money but it's difficult work . I'm always afraid of making a mistake .
8,6,-1,Well , there's nothing much wrong with you . You're under too much pressure .

1,6,-1,Hi , Francis , how was your business trip ?
2,1,-1,It was a nightmare .
3,6,-1,What ' s up ?
4,6,-1,Actually , the business trip itself was very successful . We arrived on time , we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year .
5,6,-1,Sounds quite fruitful , why do you call it still a nightmare then ?
6,1,-1,Well , the air line lost my luggage on the return flight and then I lost my carry on bag when I was tackling with the officers in charge . I left the airport three hours later than I expected and then I was caught in a traffic jam . When I finally got home , I was totally exhausted . But I found the elevator was out of service due to a blackout .
7,6,-1,This is really a sad story . Did they trace back your luggage ?
8,1,-1,I am still waiting for their call .
9,6,-1,Take it easy , all sufferings have their reward .

2,1,-1,I'm sorry . Something is wrong with my taxi .
3,6,-1,Where does it go wrong ?
4,6,-1,Let me stop my car for check . Oh , my god . I got a flat tyre .
5,6,-1,Can it keep going ?
6,1,-1,Sorry . You'd better get off for taking another taxi .

1,6,-1,I am a student in Cambridge University . I read your ad , I want to know something more about your room , please ?
2,6,-1,It's a big bedroom with a drawing room , facing a beautiful wood .
3,6,-1,Is there a bathroom ?
4,6,-1,No , but there is one downstairs , which my daughter used some years ago .
5,0,-1,It sounds good . Could I go and see it myself ?
6,6,-1,Certainly , you're welcome anytime .
7,6,-1,See you later !
8,6,-1,( after a while ) Good afternoon , Mrs . Smith . I called you just now .
9,0,-1,Welcome ! Come in , please !
10,6,-1,Yes .
11,6,-1,This way please . Your room is upstairs ... Here it is .
12,0,-1,Wonderful ! A modest , comfortable room . Ah , a beautiful window , through which I can see a beautiful scene , and hear the birds singing . How nice !
13,6,-1,Yes , if you want to wash something , there is a separate lavatory room outside .

2,6,-1,Ten to nine .
3,6,-1,Your watch is ten minutes slow . So it's should be nine sharp . I'm gonna be late again . What will be my excuse this time ? It should be set the alarm for seven thirty .
4,6,-1,Don't cry over spilled milk , Fred ? Could you stay with me a few minutes ?
5,6,-1,What ? Why ? What's wrong with you ?
6,1,-1,I just hate being alone at home with nothing to do about listen to the clock ticking . It ' s so lonely and boring . My sickness makes it worse . When will I recover ?
7,6,-1,You will be fine in the couple of month , just be patient . I've got to woke now , I'll be late .
8,1,-1,You only care about your work .
9,6,-1,Sorry , baby , you are everything to me . all I do just for our family .
10,6,-1,Stay just a few minutes longer , OK ?
11,6,-1,OK , I'll leave at 9:15 , Is that all right ?
12,0,-1,Yes .
13,6,-1,I'll spent more time with you in the future , Dina .

4,0,-1,Sure , that sounds great . Where are your appetizers listed ?
5,6,-1,There is a special appetizer menu right here in the center of the table .
6,6,-1,The chicken and cheese quesadilla looks good . Is that pretty good ?
7,0,-1,You know , that is one of my favorites !
8,6,-1,OK , I'll take one order of that .
9,6,-1,You could choose another appetizer for half price to share .
10,0,-1,Perfect ! Please add on an order of onion rings .

1,5,-1,What are we going to do ? I can't get the car out of this ditch . I'm stuck !
2,6,-1,I'm worried , Tom . I haven't seen any other cars for almost an hour .
3,5,-1,I know . This is terrible . What can we do ? This snow doesn't stop falling !
4,6,-1,I told you we should have stayed in town today . The weather report said 100 percent chance of snow . Why did you want to come up here ?
5,6,-1,I wanted to show you the cabin . We only had another half-hour to go .
6,6,-1,Well , now we're stuck . What can we do ?
7,6,-1,I don't know .
8,6,-1,I've heard that when this happens , it's important to save energy .
9,6,-1,What do you mean ?
10,6,-1,We're stranded here , Tom . We may be here a long time . We need to conserve the gas in the car . The car's energy is what will keep us warm .
11,6,-1,I have plenty of gas .
12,6,-1,Yes , but the gas and the battery both have to stay working . We can't just let the car run and run . If we do , it will die soon . Then we'll freeze .
13,6,-1,So what can we do ?
14,6,-1,Turn the lights off . Then , run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . That will conserve the heat as long as possible .
15,0,-1,Alright . That's a good idea .
16,6,-1,I wish we hadn't come up here . Now we'll probably be here for days .
17,6,-1,Days ?
18,6,-1,Yes , it happens . That is what happens in big snowstorms . People get stranded for days .
19,3,-1,Oh , my God ! It's good we have food .
20,6,-1,Probably we'll survive . But turn the car off for about forty-five minutes . Then we'll turn it on again .

1,3,-1,what happened ? Why didn't he win ?
2,6,-1,didn't you hear ? He was disqualified .
3,3,-1,how did that happen ? He's so talented ! I thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal !
4,6,-1,if he didn't have any drug problems , he would have won .
5,3,-1,what ? What kind of drugs was he using ?
6,6,-1,he was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster .
7,6,-1,I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs .
8,6,-1,they are . The reason why they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards .
9,6,-1,that's so disappointing . I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs .
10,6,-1,I don't think it's right , but I can understand why they might . Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country !
11,6,-1,regardless of how much pressure you're under , there's never a good reason to take drugs .
12,6,-1,I agree . Hopefully with the new regulations , fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs .
13,6,-1,let's hope so .

5,4,-1,No , you don ' t understand , I need this tomorrow morning ! I accidentally spilled beer all over my wife ' s dress and we have a wedding to attend tomorrow ! She ' s gonna kill me !
6,6,-1,OK , I can have it ready tomorrow afternoon , but this suit is also very stained . I can ' t guarantee we can remove it completely .
7,6,-1,Fine ! Can you also iron and starch this shirt ?
8,0,-1,Certainly .
9,0,-1,Great ! This is our secret ! If you see my wife , say nothing to her about this !

2,6,-1,You need to take a break , maybe a vacation .
3,1,-1,Oh , yes , indeed . I've run out of steam . To be honest , I want to be in a different environment .
4,3,-1,Is that so ?
5,6,-1,Yes , I don't want to be stuck in a rut . I want to move on .
6,6,-1,Have you decided ?
7,6,-1,Yes . I want to get a better job .
8,6,-1,Could you tell me why you want to quit ?
9,6,-1,I quit just because of the dissatisfying salary and the trouble in getting along with my colleagues .
10,6,-1,Oh , that's terrible . Do you want to get a higher salary in our company ?
11,6,-1,I'm afraid not . I've promised my girlfriend . We'll travel southwards to find a job that offers higher pay .
12,6,-1,OK , I'd like to say that I've really enjoyed working with you . However , I think you should work harder for your new job and then you can ask for higher pay .
13,6,-1,Thank you so much for your advice .

5,6,-1,I should get the items within a week . But in the meantime I'm bidding on a digital video camera .

2,0,-1,I always love skiing . You know , it's a cool game for cool people . Stay with me and you will be cool , too .
3,0,-1,Hey , look over there . It seems that there is something interesting going on . Let's go and have a look .
4,6,-1,Sure . It's probably the skiing show . Adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .
5,6,-1,See that . It's so dangerous . My mom would never allow me to do that .
6,6,-1,Hey , don't be so pathetic . It's a maximal sports show . What else can they do to attract more visitors ? Stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
7,6,-1,You are right . But what if the avalanche happened ?
8,6,-1,They are all very experienced and great skiers . So I suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
9,6,-1,Anyway , the show is breathtaking . By the way , where did they get so much snow in here ?
10,3,-1,Don't you know that ? Are you kidding me ?
11,6,-1,Hey , not everyone is as lucky as you to have a father who is a scientist .
12,6,-1,Sorry . Well , they have the most advanced snowmaking machine .
13,6,-1,Do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
14,6,-1,It's possible . But the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
15,0,-1,It's a good thing . OK , let's go skiing .
