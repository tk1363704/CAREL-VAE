12	null	null	I know who we can ask . There is a girl I know , Sara Ralston . She is 17 , and she will usually take this kind of job . I know her from my church , and I trust her completely .

2	null	null	I'm sorry I can't bring better news , sir . The site is a disaster .
3	null	null	That's what I was afraid of .
4	null	null	It is not only the earthquake , sir . But the mudslides . Much of the north half of the site has been covered over by mud .
5	surprise	null	Mud ? But Ivan told me there were no mudslides in that district . I thought all the mudslides were down in Chichitango .
6	null	null	That's what we thought , sir . That's what the news reported . But there was one little mudslide in our district too . Right above our site .
7	sadness	null	Oh , that's terrible ! What bad luck ! I wish we had never come to this country . But , if it isn't the strikes and the revolutionaries , it's the earthquakes . Our operations here are finished !
8	sadness	null	I'm sorry , sir .
9	null	null	It's not your fault , Yuri . But tell me . When will Ivan be able to get out there ?
10	null	null	Well , it took me about nine hours to get back here by car . If Ivan leaves tonight , I think he should be there by tomorrow lunch .
11	null	null	Good . I want an estimate of damages as soon as possible .
12	null	null	But sir ...
13	null	null	Yes , Yuri ?
14	null	null	I wouldn't recommend sending Ivan now . Especially not at night . The roads aren't safe .
15	null	null	Has the earthquake damaged the bridges too ?
16	null	null	No , sir . The bridges are fine . But I've heard rumors that the revolutionaries are coming down from the mountains . There has been fighting , sir .
17	null	null	Are you serious ? Fighting ? But I didn't hear anything on the news .
18	null	null	You know the government controls the press here , sir . They don't want it reported .
19	sadness	null	Oh , this is terrible , Yuri . Terrible ! So we can't even assess the damages . How can we do business in this country ? Either we're buried under mud , or we're in danger of getting kidnapped . No , I can't believe this mess !
20	sadness	null	I'm sorry , sir .
21	sadness	null	You don't have to keep saying that , Yuri . It's not your fault . But me--I'm the one who should be sorry . It was me who suggested operations here in the first place ! Oh , what can we do ?

7	null	null	How about this scarf , these earrings , and an anklet ?
8	null	null	That might be going overboard a bit . How about just that scarf with a bracelet ?
9	happiness	null	That's a good idea . You have a lot of good fashion sense .
10	happiness	null	Thanks . You'd be OK on your own . There are loads of fashion victims out there , and you are not one of them . Have you tried it on yet ?
11	null	null	Yep . Here it is . What do you think ?
12	happiness	null	That looks great . Just one more thing-you need some high heels with those jeans . Do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ?

6	null	null	What do you think of this job ?
7	null	null	I am not familiar with the medicine industry , and I don't think it fits me well .
8	null	null	Then how about the others ?
9	null	null	Another is about electronic commerce , and its products are mainly large machinery equipments .
10	null	null	I have heard about electronic commerce , and many people say it has good prospects for development .
11	null	null	I also feel it's nice . I want to give it a try .
12	happiness	null	Come on ! I believe you will succeed .
13	happiness	null	Thanks . You can also seek job information on the Internet .

2	null	null	Oh , my dear lady , take it easy . You should forgive a green hand like him .
3	anger	null	He does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy .
4	null	null	I suggest you talk with him and teach him how to deal with the problems .
5	anger	null	I've told him how to do that several times , but he's never listened to me .
6	null	null	Maybe you should communicate with him just like a friend , not a boss .
7	sadness	null	Oh , I always have difficulty in getting along with the staff .
8	null	null	Just take them for your good friends and have a talk with them as we do . Make sure you won't lose your temper !
9	null	null	Oh , so bad . I'm afraid I'll change the image of myself .
10	null	null	No , it's unnecessary . Just respect the staff and their own opinions .
11	null	null	But sometimes they offer some useless proposals , it's awfully useless .
12	null	null	Oh , no one is perfect .
13	null	null	That's right . I should speak to them in a polite way .

2	null	null	Honey , what's up ?
3	fear	null	I was stuck between 15th and 16th floors in the elevator .
4	surprise	null	Oh , really ? I know that telephone signal must have been shielded in the elevator shaft , so what did you do then ?
5	fear	null	I pressed the emergency button ! And then I stayed in the elevator waiting for the rescue .
6	null	null	Did you panic at the time ?
7	null	null	A little bit , but I know that the elevator isn't enclosed . at least I wouldn't be smothered there .
8	null	null	Was there anyone else with you ?
9	null	null	Of course , there are 6 other people in the elevator ; they were so scared that someone even started crying .
10	null	null	So you mean that you were the only brave one there ?
11	null	null	Yes . I have to call the property management .
12	null	null	For what ? Complaining about what happened in the elevator ?
13	null	null	Yes . They should check the elevator regularly . I have to give them something to remember about , and they should also equip fire extinguishers in the building .
14	null	null	That was just an accident . you are worried too much about it . I think the property management will check the elevator and improve their service from now on .
15	null	null	I know what you mean , but I'd better remind them again , and also remind them to repair the button in the elevator for the disabled people . That has brought the disabled people lots of inconvenience .

8	null	null	How much are you willing to pay ?
9	null	null	Shall we make it 250 dollars ?

5	null	null	no , I don't have an plans to go to a formal dance any time soon , but I love the way it looks . I just had to try it on ! What do you think about this ? It ' s casual , yet sophisticated .
6	null	null	I like the jeans , but you need something to go with the top . It ' s too plain on its own .
7	null	null	how about this scarf , these earrings , and an anklet ?
8	null	null	that might be going overboard a bit . How about just that scarf with a bracelet ?
9	happiness	null	that ' s a good idea . You have a lot of good fashion sense .
10	happiness	null	thanks . You ' d be ok on your own . There are loads of fashion victims out there , and you are not one of them . Have you tried it on yet ?
11	null	null	yep . Here it is . What do you think ?
12	happiness	null	that looks great . Just one more thing---you need some high heels with those jeans . Do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ?
13	null	null	the leopard print sounds fabulous . Are they a name brand ?
14	null	null	no , they ' re a Prada knock-off for 1/10 of the price of the real thing .
15	null	null	that ' s even better than the real thing .
16	null	null	if I were you , I ' d buy that now while it ' s on sale . If you spend more than $ 100 , you get a $ 50 voucher for more clothes .

2	null	null	There ' s so much I want to do . I ' Ve just finished sending lots of emails to friends and family all over the world . I just ran a search for music to download .
3	null	null	I can give you the name of a few useful website to visit .
4	happiness	null	Thanks . That would be very helpful . I ' Ve discovered that it can take a long time to find exactly what you want . There ' s too much information on the net .
5	null	null	When you sent your emails , did you attach any files to them ?
6	null	null	Yes , I did . There ' s an anti-virus programme with my email account that scans all attachments , so I ' m sure I haven ' t sent anything nasty to anyone .
7	null	null	When you use the internet , be careful not to give out your email address very often . If you do , you might get a lot of spam-unwanted email form companies trying to sell you things .
8	happiness	null	That ' s good advice . I should also be careful about giving out confidential information about myself , such as my password and credit car number .
9	null	null	That ' s right . Another thing to remember when you are surfing is that you can add a web page to your list of favourites . Your computer will remember the page and you can return there quickly next time
10	null	null	How do I do that ?
11	null	null	Take this web page for example . Press the keys control and d together . Click on favourites at the top of the screen . There you are . It has been added to you favourites list . If you click it , you will
12	happiness	null	That ' s useful to know . Thanks . I ' ll just log off and shout down my computer and we can go for a coffee .

11	null	null	It doesn't matter . I still can go out and buy a beer .

13	anger	null	Yes , that's true . Damn ! I just lost half my paper , and now I can't even do my homework . This is a bad time for this to happen .

18	null	null	No , it just won't work . If I read for your exam , you won't know the answers tomorrow . I will .

7	null	null	I am sorry , sir , there ' s nothing I can do . You cannot board the flight with that large bag either . Carry - on bags must fit in the over-head compartment or under your seat . That bag is clearly too big .
8	anger	null	Now I see . You charge next to nothing for an international ticket , but when it comes to charging for any other small thing , you charge an arm and a leg ! So tell me , miss , how much will I have to pay for all of this .

4	happiness	null	That's right . You know , pink , green and black could also be good for you . Actually , I think that all colors are okay for a person with your complexion . It's just that different colors can give people different impressions . For example , black could make you look mature , while pink could make you look young and energetic .

4	happiness	null	That ' s correct . It ' s a murder mystery based on actual murders that book place in Florida several years ago . The main character-the police invesigator-is based on the man who investigated the case .
5	happiness	null	How do you research your books ?
6	happiness	null	I always visit the places that I use as setting for stories . Readers like things to be as factually correct as possible-even in fiction ! I usually base my characters on people I have met . Most character are a mixture of the characters of two or more people .
7	happiness	null	I really like your books . I ' Ve just finished this one . I read it from cover to cover in a single day . Congratulation on making the bestseller list yet again !
8	happiness	null	Thank you . Let met sign it for you ... there you go .

10	happiness	null	There ' s a real mix of stories in the book . I haven ' t finished all of them yet , though . Many of them are short detective stories , but there are also horror stories and sci-fi ones . If you give me your business card , I ' ll make sure you get an advance copy to review .

8	null	null	ok . What do you think about our living room ?
9	null	null	well , I do like the mantelpiece and the coffee table , but I don ' t really care for curtains . Did you get them at a yard sale ? They look ancient .
10	null	null	my parents gave them to us as a house warming gift .
11	null	null	oh dear . Well , I suppose they will do for now . do you ever dust in here ? It seems a bit dusty in here .

3	null	null	I met with the supervisor just this morning . I don't know , but I am a little worried . Who do you think will get sacked ?
4	null	null	I'm not sure ... well , first , it couldn't be George . He is such a kiss-ass . He'd wash the boss's dog if he asked .
5	null	null	No , it's not going to be George . I don't think it's Andy either . He is involved with the boss's sister in-law . And you know how whipped our boss is .
6	null	null	That's true . What about Lisa ? I bet there's nobody who could do a worse job than her .
7	null	null	Lisa ? No way . I've heard a rumor that she and the boss were having an affair . You know rumors can't come out from nowhere .
8	null	null	Well , okay . Then there is still Michael . But he's the boss ' pet after having the best sales record for three months in a row . It definitely won't be Michael .
9	sadness	null	No , that would be crazy . But then who will it be ? Oh dear , it must be me . I should have known it ! Why else would he have talked to me alone about the downsizing . What should I do ? I've got a family to support .
10	sadness	null	Well , it could be me too . But I am not too worried . This place is suffocating me with this boss being such a hard-ass and colleagues who barely know how to get dressed in the morning . It would almost be a blessing to be fired from this place .

2	happiness	null	I love all the fashionable things . But my favorite brand is Chanel .
3	null	null	Oh , that's a very expensive brand , but with good reason .
4	happiness	null	Yeah . Each style is specially designed by world's top designers . So they can always make you look amazing .
5	null	null	I see . Come here . The high heels here look really attractive . But I wonder whether it's comfortable to wear any of them ?
6	null	null	Not really , especially at the beginning , if you wear high heels all day long , your feet would hurt . But , no big deal . Women can always get used to that .
7	null	null	It's not a simple thing to be beautiful .
8	null	null	Sure . But everyone loves to be beautiful . Hey , do you think this pair of sunglasses matches the handbag well ?
9	surprise	null	Yeah , very tasteful . And with them , you look even more fashionable . Oh , there are so many French perfumers . Oops , perfumes for guys ? So strange !
10	null	null	Come on . Fashion is not only for women . Men also share the equal right to chase fashion . It's the new fashion for men to wear perfumes , which is called cologne .
11	surprise	null	Oh , really , that's really something new . I'm afraid not everyone can accept it .
12	null	null	It takes time for that . But people's consuming attitudes are changing quickly .
13	null	null	That's true . Well , it's obvious that fashion is not a cheap thing . So , do you spend all your money on it ?
14	null	null	No . Fashion is just part of my life , which improves its quality . But also , I'm good at financing . I have a credit card , but I never overdraft .
15	null	null	How is it that you are my mom's sis ? You two are so different . She always picks up bargains and spends more than she earns . You do so much better than her .
16	null	null	I have to say that's just the result of difference of our consumptive habits .

3	surprise	null	How did that happen ? He's so talented ! I thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal !
4	null	null	If he didn't have any drug problems , he would have won .
5	surprise	null	What ? What kind of drugs was he using ?
6	null	null	He was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster .
7	disgust	null	I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs .
8	disgust	null	They are . The only reason they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards .
9	disgust	null	That's so disappointing . I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs .
10	disgust	null	I don't think it's right , but I can understand why they might . Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country !
11	null	null	Regardless of how much pressure you're under , there's never a good reason to take drugs .
12	null	null	I agree . Hopefully with the new regulations , fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs .

2	null	null	You just don't get it . Looking for bargains can be really interesting .
3	null	null	Are you serious ? How can that be ?
4	null	null	Bargaining is a game , or even a battle . You feel like a winner when you get a good price .
5	null	null	Come on . You know , you can never really win . The salesperson never loses . They make their living out of it .
6	null	null	That's true . But I just love it . Come here !
7	happiness	null	Oh , this silk carpet is really beautiful . Look at the pattern , and how delicate it is !

9	happiness	null	Really ? Oh , this one . I like the cloisonn vase .
10	happiness	null	Are you kidding me ? I bought a same one last week . It's surprising that there is something we both like . Well , what do you think of these ceramic cups ?
11	null	null	Come on . They look so cheap . Something else , please .
12	null	null	What about this picture ? I think Benjamin would like it .
13	null	null	Don't underestimate his taste . I don't think he'd like it .
14	null	null	Don't be so sure . He loves the vase I bought here last week .

10	null	null	It looks like the hairstyle of Kahn who stands beside him in the picture .
11	sadness	null	Oh . I made a mistake . I thought the guy on the right was Peckham .
12	null	null	He plays outside right but it doesn't mean he has to stand on the right .

3	null	null	The point is that she has been persuading me to lose weight too .
4	null	null	Well , it's a good thing for you .
5	surprise	null	Good ? Yes , it's good for her but not for me . You see , she tells me that I'll feel better about myself if I slim down . She keeps giving me newspaper clippings about the latest miracle diet and insists that I join a health club , as she has .
6	surprise	null	So you don't think you are fat and need to lose weight ?

10	null	null	Ok , but junk food has many disadvantages . As junk food contains high amount of oil and fat , you'll feel sleepy , but not be able to concentrate when you have a lot of it .

4	null	null	Well , I can teach you how I make them , which is the same way my father and grandmother make them , which is a little special .
5	happiness	null	OK . Yeah ! Yeah !
6	null	null	First you take some eggs and crack them in a bowl , and whisk them up , quite , so they're quite high and fluffy , and in a hot pan , and you need a pan that's that's kind of small , that the sides go up at an angle . You put some oil and heat it up , so it's quite hot , and then you take your whipped up eggs , or whisked up eggs , and pour them into the pan , and as it's cooking , if you take a spatula , and push the bottom layer of the egg , to the side , to the sides , and then to the middle , so the uncooked egg gets to the bottom of the pan .
7	happiness	null	Oh , OK . Wow !
8	null	null	OK . And keep doing that until most of the egg is cooked so you should have a nice thick omelet and then flip it over , you'll only have to cook that side lightly . Put your fillings on the top and fold it over and let it sit just long enough to melt the cheese .

5	null	null	I think my arm is broken .

15	null	null	It really hurts .
16	null	null	Yes , maybe it does . But if you're going to drive like you did just now , you will have to get used to a little physical pain . You know what I mean ?
17	anger	null	To hell with you . The accident was your fault .
18	null	null	I'm afraid it wasn't . And when the police get here , you will also see that it wasn't . But enough of this bickering . I'm going to go find a phone . Don ' t move that arm while I'm gone . Alright ?

3	anger	null	There was plenty of room for me to pull out . You didn't have to stay in the lane you were in .
4	null	null	Hey , listen . I had every right to stay in the lane I was in . You were supposed to wait until I passed to pull out . And anyhow , you didn't give me any time to change lanes . All of a sudden--BANG--there you are right in front of me .
5	null	null	I think my arm is broken .
6	null	null	Sorry about your arm , but it serves you right . You need to learn how to drive . You're lucky you didn't get killed . And I'm lucky to be alive too .

8	null	null	Fine with me . I know the laws of the road . I'm not worried .
9	null	null	I have a cell phone in my car . Now it's probably on the floor on the passenger side . Why don't you get it for me , and then I can call the police ?

11	anger	null	It doesn't work . It looks like it's broken . I need to get to a hospital . You should drive me there .
12	null	null	Oh , yeah ? It's better if we make a police report first . Then you can go to the hospital .
13	anger	null	Damn it ! I'm injured here . We could wait all day for the police .
14	null	null	Well , you'll just have to wait . I'm not going to move my car until the police arrive . I'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone . Don't worry . You'll get to the hospital in time .
15	anger	null	It really hurts .
16	null	null	Yes , maybe it does . But if you're going to drive like you did just now , you will have to get used to a little physical pain . You know what I mean ?
17	anger	null	To hell with you . The accident was your fault .
18	null	null	I'm afraid it wasn't . And when the police get here , you will also see that it wasn't . But enough of this bickering . I'm going to go find a phone . Don ' t move that arm while I'm gone . Alright ?

5	null	null	What type of diet were you on ?
6	null	null	I joined a health club and my trainer gave me tips on eating . With a combination of eating better and exercising , I managed to lose 15 pounds in 2 months .
7	happiness	null	That's amazing . What tips did your trainer give you ?
8	null	null	Mostly on how to exercise , but the best advice I got was changing my eating habits . Instead of eating 3 times a day , she told me to eat 5 times a day .
9	null	null	That doesn't make sense . If you eat more , than how do you lose weight ?
10	null	null	Actually , I'm eating the same amount . I eat 5 smaller meals a day . Basically , it naturally speeds up the metabolism and helps to burn fat at a faster rate .
11	null	null	That makes sense . I'm going to try that .
12	null	null	You don't need to lose weight .
13	null	null	I have a little gut I have been trying to get rid of .
