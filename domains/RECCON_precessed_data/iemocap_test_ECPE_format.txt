1	excited	null	Ahh. It sent shivers up my spine.
2	excited	null	What shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us?
3	excited	null	Behave exquisitely.
4	excited	null	With the most perfect poise.
5	excited	null	Certainly I shall probably do a court curtsy.
6	excited	null	Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter at all when one's happy, do they?
7	null	null	Don't say that, my darling.
8	excited	null	It's true the whole business is very poor joke.
9	excited	null	Don't laugh at me. I'm serious.
10	null	null	Who's they?
11	excited	null	Oh, how long will it last, this ludicrous, over-bearing love of ours?
12	null	null	Well who knows?
13	null	null	What happens if one of us dies? Does the one that's left still laugh?
14	excited	null	Thank you, dear. The same applies to you except that if I catch you so much as looking at another woman, I'll kill you.
15	null	null	Do you remember that awful scene in Venice?
16	excited	null	Which particular one?
17	null	null	The one where you bought that little painted wooden snake and put it on my bed.
18	excited	null	Oh, Charles. That was his name. Charles he did wriggle so beautifully.
19	null	null	Horrible thing. I hated it.
20	excited	null	Yes, I know you did. You threw him out of the window into the Grand Canal. I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.
21	null	null	How long did that row last?
22	null	null	The worst one was in Cannes when your curling irons burnt holes in my dressing gown.
23	excited	null	It burnt my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom.
24	excited	null	Then the manager came in and found us rolling about on the floor biting and scratching like panthers.
25	excited	null	How ridiculous. How utterly, utterly ridiculous.
26	excited	null	And very much sillier.

1	excited	null	Hey, what time is it? They're supposed to run around midnight, right? God, this is great, isn't it?
2	excited	null	Look at the night we got; couldn't be better.
3	excited	null	You know actually, I wanted to go a little further up the coast to get away from all the, the people and the lights, and uh- but I thought we'd miss it. Hey, how you doing?
4	sad	null	Fine.
5	excited	null	Oh, is that-is that-now, is that just foam, uhh, I can't even tell.
6	excited	null	Oh, though if I can't tell it probably isn't them, right? It probably would be unmistakable, wouldn't you think? Hey, how you doing?
7	excited	null	Oh, do you know what I forgot? I forgot my flashlight. How could I be so stupid. Oh, I-I should have brought my flashlight.
8	excited	null	Uh- you know, the flashlight. The silver one. There's only one, isn't there?
9	angry	null	I don't understand why you're always saying oh, it's mine, it's mine. It's not like it's just your flashlight. I mean, how do you think that makes me feel?
10	excited	null	We should have brought our flashlight. I can't believe we forgot to bring it.
11	excited	null	I hope the moon stays out.
12	excited	null	Hey, do they always run during a full moon? I can't remember if it was full last year. Do you remember?
13	excited	null	We should have brought the blanket. Oh, why didn't we bring the blanket? Our blanket.
14	excited	null	You know what would be good right now? A six-pack. Ah, I can't believe I forgot a six-pack. A six-pack would be just the ticket right about now.
15	excited	null	I'm so stupid. I'm like a little kid. I-it's amazing I get out of the house with my fly zipped. Oh- [LAUGHTER].
16	excited	null	I wonder if they can hear us talk. Or hear the vibrations in the sand when we move.
17	null	null	Do you want my jacket?
18	null	null	Right.
19	null	null	Yeah, that's my point too.
20	excited	null	No. No, no, no, that's not my point. My point is there's no point in coming down here if we just turn around and leave.
21	null	null	I mean, don't you want to see it?
22	sad	null	Not particularly.
23	null	null	Why not?
24	sad	null	I don't know. I just don't.
25	angry	null	Pass up what? A bunch of fish. They swim up to the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die.
26	frustrated	null	I don't know why you're getting so excited. I mean, it's not like the landing of the moon or something. It's just fish. Fish that nobody eats.
27	frustrated	null	Oh, God, Augie.
28	frustrated	null	Yes, and if you also remember, I got sand in my panties. We got into an argument about nothing. You got a sore throat and we never saw the grunions.
29	frustrated	null	No, for God's sakes, we've never seen the grunions. We're not going to see them.
30	frustrated	null	We just weren't in a good spot, all right? This is a much better spot. I have a good instinct for these things. Look, is that-
31	excited	null	I wouldn't miss this for anything. I mean, think about this. Okay, I know you're not interested, but just think about this for a minute.
32	excited	null	And they all, all as one, turned as one and formed this line as big as the California coast and started swimming this way. Swimming as if that's the only thing that matters.
33	excited	null	You know, they didn't ask it a question. They didn't, they didn't take a vote. They didn't have an invitation or a map; they just started swimming as one.
34	excited	null	its single-mindedness with one mind. Urgency that's pure urge. You know, they don't give it a name.
35	excited	null	They don't ask it a question. They just, they just, they don't know what drives them. They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them to here
36	excited	null	where we stand for a massive celebration of sex and death. Oh, God, I'm giving myself goosebumps. Look, I'm all-all my hairs on my arms is sticking up.
37	null	null	About what I just said.

11	sad	null	I hope so.
12	sad	null	It's going to be really rough.
13	sad	null	You gotta take care of our baby for me, alright?
14	sad	null	I'll send you lots of pictures.
15	sad	null	I hope so, because I'm not going to be able to survive without all that. I don't know what I'm going to do.
16	sad	null	I've never been - I've never been away from you for two weeks let alone a year.
17	sad	null	Well, just promise me that you going to be safe.
18	sad	null	I mean can't they put you in like, you know kitchen work or something where you won't get
19	frustrated	null	It doesn't make any sense; I don't know why we have to be at war in the first place.
20	sad	null	there's people that thought it was the right thing to do so now we have to- we have to do what we have to do for our country
21	null	null	and it'll work out you know, go there and do that. Yeah, I'll be back
22	sad	null	Will you write me letters, paper ones?
23	sad	null	Our baby needs a dad; you can't leave. Okay, you can't disappear.
24	sad	null	Our baby has a dad, alright. Daddy is going to be back soon.
25	sad	null	I want you to, you know, take lots of video; pictures and I can see you when I get back or while I'm there. I'm going to miss you.

1	sad	null	What's he going to say? Maybe we should tell him before he sees it.
2	sad	null	He saw it.
3	sad	null	He was out here when it broke.
4	sad	null	Around Four this morning, and there was a crack and I looked out. We're standing right there when I cracked.
5	sad	null	I don't know. but When it cracked he ran back into the house and start to cry in the kitchen.
6	sad	null	Did you talk to him?
7	sad	null	No. I figured it was best to leave him alone.
8	sad	null	He cried hard.
9	sad	null	I could hear him right through the floor of my room.
10	sad	null	He is thinking about him again.
11	sad	null	It's getting just like after Larry died, he's having dreams, he's walking around at night.
12	sad	null	I guess, he is.
13	sad	null	What's the meaning of that?
14	sad	null	I don't know the meaning of it. But I know one thing mom did. We made a terrible mistake with dad.
15	sad	null	Being dishonest with him. It's the kind of thing that pays off and now it's paying off.
16	sad	null	You know that Larry's not coming back, and I know it. So why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him?
17	frustrated	null	No um, I don't want to argue with him, but it's time we realized that nobody else believes that Larry is alive.
18	frustrated	null	Why shouldn't he dream about him, walk around during the night, looking for him um. Do we contradict him? Do we say outright that we don't have any hope anymore, that we haven't had any for years now?
19	frustrated	null	We have to say it to him!
20	angry	null	For God's sake, mom, three years. Nobody comes back after three years! It's insane!
21	frustrated	null	To you it is, and to me, but not to your father. Now look, you can talk yourself blue in the face, but there's no body, and there's no grave, so where are you?
22	frustrated	null	Sit down, mom. I want to talk to you.
23	frustrated	null	All right, All right mom. Listen!
24	sad	null	You know why I asked Annie here, don't you?
25	frustrated	null	You know.
26	null	null	Well I got an idea. But what's the story?
27	null	null	I'm going to ask her to marry me.
28	frustrated	null	You know that's not just my business.
29	frustrated	null	So it's all right. I can go ahead with it then?
30	frustrated	null	I ignore what I got to ignore. The girl is Larry's girl.
31	frustrated	null	Now Chris you can go on from there, but I don't know what to do. I mean do you know what to do, because I don't.
32	frustrated	null	I don't know why it is. But every time I reach out for something I want, I have to pull back because other people will suffer. My whole bloody life, time after time, after time.
33	null	null	Well you're a considerate fellow, there's nothing wrong with that.
34	angry	null	To hell with that!
35	null	null	Have you asked Annie yet to marry you?
36	null	null	Well how did you know that she will go along with it, I mean maybe she feels the same way as your father?
37	null	null	The trouble is you don't see enough women, you never have
38	frustrated	null	So what, I'm not fast with women.
39	null	null	Well I just don't see why it has to be Annie.
40	frustrated	null	Because it is.
41	frustrated	null	I can't help it. I know her best. I was brought up next door to here, the easiest, when I think of somebody for my wife, I think of Annie. Do you want a diagram?
42	frustrated	null	No, I don't want a diagram, but, Chris, your father thinks Larry's coming back.
43	sad	null	You marry his girl, and you're pronouncing him dead. Now what's going to happen to your father, do you know? I don't.
44	frustrated	null	All right, then, Mom.
45	frustrated	null	I've given it three years of thought. And hope by now that he wouldn't. Can you forget about Larry an-- and we can have a regular wedding and have everybody be happy. But that can't happen here, I'm set to get out.
46	angry	null	What the hell is this?
47	frustrated	null	I'll get out. I'll get married and live some place else. Maybe, maybe New York?
48	angry	null	Are you crazy?
49	frustrated	null	Wait a minute. Tell me this. Do you mean to say that you would leave the business?
50	angry	null	The business? The business? It doesn't inspire me?
51	frustrated	null	Don't- you, you can't think like that! Don't think like that!
52	angry	null	All right! But don't think like that, because I mean, what the hell did we do all this for, Chris? The whole business it's all for you! The whole shooting match is for you!
53	frustrated	null	I don't understand you, do I?

1	null	null	Look at this, goose bumps.
2	null	null	Well so what'd you think?
3	null	null	What I said.
4	frustrated	null	Certainly is not. It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.
5	frustrated	null	Carla, can I ask you something? Don't take this the wrong way, but are you having your period?
6	angry	null	Goddamn it, Augie, don't ask me that. I hate it when you ask me that. You always ask me that. It's insulting.
7	angry	null	Well what's bugging you?
8	angry	null	We just have different ideas about what this evening is supposed to look like.
9	angry	null	There's nothing to it. We come down here. The grunions arrive. They do their little fish business. We go ooh, ah, look at the fish. They go home. We go home.
10	angry	null	We never do, do we? Have we ever?
11	frustrated	null	Twice is every time we've tried. That's ever.
12	frustrated	null	We'll see them this year.
13	frustrated	null	You don't have any idea what I'm saying.
14	frustrated	null	No, of course, not.
15	angry	null	I did want to see it. I always do. I keep thinking this time will be the time, but it never is.
16	frustrated	null	It's just fish; nothing to get traumatized over.
17	frustrated	null	I've been trying to work this backwards, but I can't seem to pinpoint the moment when we took a turn for the worse.
18	frustrated	null	You were fine during the phone call from Marge. Dinner was okay. Doing the dishes was no problem. Let's see, I took a shower. Uh, you watched the news. You said the grunions are running tonight. I said great, let's go. I feel lucky tonight.
19	frustrated	null	Uh,okay. So I'm putting on my jacket; putting out the animals;
20	frustrated	null	uh, taking the car out of the gara- out of the garage.
21	frustrated	null	Uh.
22	sad	null	It was about four years ago, right after we got married. We thought I was pregnant and we had a bottle of champagne but no glasses. You asked me to dance. So we took off our shoes and you popped the cork.
23	null	null	Wait a minute, I've got it.
24	sad	null	Dancing barefoot in the sand; drinking champagne from the bottle.
25	null	null	It was in the car, right? Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker? You said let's get some champagne and I said times a wasting or something like that. Right? That's it, right? You want this to be like the other time. That's it. Of course.
26	sad	null	I'd rather not remember some things. I'd rather not hope for some things.
27	sad	null	No.
28	sad	null	No.
29	frustrated	null	What, you want me to breathe in your ear?
30	frustrated	null	No.
31	frustrated	null	You want to get married again?
32	frustrated	null	No.
33	frustrated	null	What, you want a divorce?
34	frustrated	null	No.
35	frustrated	null	A vacation?
36	angry	null	No.
37	angry	null	I want something to turn out the way it's supposed to.
38	angry	null	Well welcome to the human race. You think this is what I had in mind? You think that when I proposed, I had this great fantasy going that four years down the line, we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish? No.
39	angry	null	And we'll have three fat rosy kids and ha, ha, ha, baby, the joke's on us, 'cause you know what you get, Carla? You know what you get? This.
40	angry	null	This what? What is this? This isn't even anything.
41	frustrated	null	Yes, it is.
42	angry	null	Oh, right, sure. This is standing on the beach. This is waiting. This is fighting.
43	frustrated	null	Right.
44	angry	null	But this isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.
45	angry	null	No, I know, me neither.
46	frustrated	null	I'm doing the best I can.
47	frustrated	null	I know you are, Augie. Really, I do. I know you meant for this to be special and nice and it's the full moon and the sand and everything. But I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.
48	sad	null	I didn't say that.
49	sad	null	No, I know. But still. I know I don't make you happy.
50	happy	null	Actually, now that you mention it, no. I don't.
51	happy	null	Okay, fine. So we're in the wrong spot, but we're with the right person.
52	happy	null	I don't know. It seemed like a good spot to me. I mean, look at the view you've got of the moon from here.
53	happy	null	Yeah, I noticed that. Looks pretty on the water, doesn't it? Big ol' white moon. I'm sorry, Augie.
54	happy	null	Shh. If we're very quiet, the fish might come.

1	angry	null	Why did he invite her here?
2	frustrated	null	Why does that bother you?
3	angry	null	Well she's been away for three and a half years in New York and suddenly she just shows up.
4	null	null	Well maybe, maybe he just wanted to see her.
5	frustrated	null	uh-uh What do you mean? They grew up next to each other their entire lives. Why shouldn't he want to see her?
6	frustrated	null	Hey don't look at me like that. I don't know anymore than you.
7	null	null	Who said he even thought about that?
8	null	null	Well, so what?
9	frustrated	null	Now listen kid...
10	angry	null	No. She's not his girl Joe and she knows that.
11	null	null	How do you know why she's waited? Hmmm?
12	angry	null	I mean, her faith is stronger than a rock.
13	sad	null	My worst times I think about her, you know, and I
14	sad	null	it's like I know as long as she's waiting I'm right again.
15	frustrated	null	Look at how nice the day is. What are we arguing for?
16	angry	null	No. Nobody in my house better dare and challenge her faith. You know and maybe strangers but not his father, not his brother.
17	frustrated	null	What do you want me to do? What do you want?
18	frustrated	null	But Kate...
19	angry	null	Laugh, laugh at me but I will. Because you know what happened when she came here? When she came back she slept in his room, the memorial broke into pieces. Joe, look. Look at it. You got to believe with me.
20	frustrated	null	Okay. Calm yourself. Just calm yourself.
21	sad	null	Look, it was just last week that Detroit, some boy came back he had been away longer than Larry, you can read it for yourself. You above all people have got to believe.

23	angry	null	Wait, what does that mean? Me above all?
24	angry	null	Look at you, you're shaking.
25	sad	null	I can't help it.

2	null	null	I know. It kind of went out of style, didn't it?
3	null	null	It's not so bad; it's a good thing.
4	null	null	[BREATHING] You know, it's lovely here. The air is sweet.
5	null	null	You're not sorry you came.
6	null	null	I'm not sorry, no. But I'm...I can't stay.
7	null	null	For one thing, your mother much as told me to go.
8	null	null	Well.
9	null	null	And then, you. You've been kind of...
10	null	null	What?
11	null	null	Sort of embarrassed ever since I got here.
12	null	null	Well I was kind of planning of sneaking up on you over the course of a week or so. They just take it for granted that we're all set.
13	null	null	I knew they would.
14	null	null	Well sure, from your mother's point of view. Why else would I come?
15	null	null	I, umm. I guess, I guess that's kind of why I came.
16	happy	null	[BREATHING]
17	happy	null	I love you. Annie, I love you.
18	happy	null	[LAUGHTER]
19	happy	null	I don't really have any imagination, that's all I know how to say.
20	happy	null	[LAUGHTER]
21	happy	null	Am I embarrassing you? Are you - See, I didn't want to do it here with this yard, on this porch. I wanted it to be somewhere new, some place fresh for both of us.
22	happy	null	No. No
23	null	null	Chris, I've been ready a long, long, time.
24	null	null	I almost got married two years ago.
25	null	null	You started to write me.
26	happy	null	Every day since.
27	happy	null	Why didn't you let me know?
28	happy	null	Give me a...
29	happy	null	Give me a kiss.
30	happy	null	beating around the bush.
31	happy	null	I will never forgive you. All I'd done was sit around wondering if I was crazy waiting so long, wondering if you were thinking about me.
32	happy	null	Oh Annie, we are going to live now. I am going to make you so happy.
33	happy	null	Not like that you're not.
34	happy	null	I kissed you.
35	null	null	Like Larry's brother. Do it like you, Chris.
36	sad	null	Hey, let's drive some place. Huh? Let's get out of here.
37	sad	null	No it's nothing like that. It's-
38	sad	null	Yeah. I suppose I have been. But it's going from me.
39	sad	null	I don't even know how to start.
40	sad	null	It's just all mixed up with so many other things, you know? You know overseas I was in command of a company?
41	null	null	Yeah, sure.
42	sad	null	Well I lost them.
43	null	null	How many?
44	sad	null	Pretty much all.
45	sad	null	Aw, geez.
46	sad	null	You can't just toss off a thing like that because they weren't just men. You know?
47	sad	null	Like for instance, there was this one time it had been raining for several days and this kid he just came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks. He just put them in my pocket. That's a little thing, you know, but that's what kind of guys I had.
48	sad	null	They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other. I mean that, exactly. Just a little more selfish and they would all be here today.
49	null	null	Mmhmm.
50	sad	null	To bring that on to the earth again, you know, is like some kind of monument and I thought I would just make a difference to them.
51	sad	null	But then I came home and it was incredible, you know? The whole thing was just kind of this random bus accident. You know, I went back to the rat race again, I went to work.
52	sad	null	And I didn't want any of it. I guess that included you.
53	null	null	I just want you to know Annie.
54	happy	null	What would I do with a fortune?

12	happy	null	Uh huh. Oh-
13	excited	null	And I'm like oh, he went to the- -the bathroom, but he didn't tell me, I didn't even notice him leaving. And all of a sudden, I swear to God, I'm sitting there and-

15	excited	null	goes up there and everyone's clapping and he's standing there and they put a spotlight on him.
16	excited	null	Oh, my God.
17	excited	null	And I'm like freaking out. I'm like what the hell's going on, you know. I don't know what's going on. And so he's like standing there and then all of a sudden they give him a microphone-

14	excited	null	Being that sacred and wonderful thing, love.

4	frustrated	null	Let me see them.
5	null	null	Is there a problem?
6	frustrated	null	Who told you to get in this line?
7	frustrated	null	Okay. But I didn't tell you to get in this line if you are filling out this particular form.
8	null	null	Well what's the problem? Let me change it.
9	frustrated	null	This form is a Z.X.four.
10	frustrated	null	You can't-- This is not the line for Z.X.four. If you're going to fill out the Z.X.four, you need to have a different form of ID.
11	frustrated	null	What? I'm getting an ID. This is why I'm here. My wallet was stolen.
12	frustrated	null	No. I need another set of ID to prove this is actually you.
13	frustrated	null	How am I supposed to get an ID without an ID? How does a person get an ID in the first place?
14	frustrated	null	I don't know. But I need an ID to pass this form along. I can't just send it along without an ID.
15	frustrated	null	I'm here to get an ID.
16	frustrated	null	No. I need another ID, a separate one.
17	frustrated	null	Like what? Like a birth certificate?
18	frustrated	null	A birth certificate, a passport...a student ID; didn't you go to school? Anything?
19	frustrated	null	Yes but my wallet was stolen, I don't have anything. I don't have any credit cards, I don't have my ID. Don't you have things on file here?
20	frustrated	null	Yeah. We keep it on file, but we need an ID to access that file.
21	angry	null	That's out of control.
22	angry	null	I don't understand why this is so complicated for people when they get here. It's just a simple form. I just need an ID.
23	frustrated	null	How long have you been working here?
24	null	null	Clearly. You know, do you have like a supervisor or something?
25	angry	null	Yeah. Do you want to see my supervisor? Huh? Yeah. Do you want to see my supervisor? Fine. I'll be right back.
26	frustrated	null	That would - I would appreciate that. Yeah.

1	null	null	Hey, what's up?
2	excited	null	Guess what came today?
3	excited	null	What?
4	excited	null	My acceptance letter.
5	excited	null	From U.S.C..
6	excited	null	Yes, I am.
7	excited	null	Well yeah, that's the general idea. [LAUGHTER]
8	excited	null	That's awesome. Congratulations.
9	excited	null	Big bad acceptance packet with all the information. I'm going to U.S.C..
10	excited	null	That's amazing. Wow.
11	excited	null	I know. [LAUGHTER]
12	excited	null	[LAUGHTER] Yeah, uh. No.
13	excited	null	[LAUGHTER] It's safe around there.
14	excited	null	The campus is beautiful. I'm so excited.
15	null	null	I know but you should get like a taser or something. I mean walking around the campus at night-
16	excited	null	Do you want to buy me some mace for my, you know, going away present?
17	excited	null	There we go. Perfect.
18	excited	null	And a taser. Excellent. Just make sure it's a big knife.
19	excited	null	I don't want any of those little puny ones.
20	null	null	So, um- so what are you going to- what are you going to major in?
21	excited	null	Well I was thinking maybe underwater basket weaving.
22	excited	null	U.S.C. has a major in that, right.
23	excited	null	They have - U.S.C. has everything because U.S.C. is the best school ever.
24	null	null	they have that as a major?
25	null	null	That's ridiculous. I don't believe that.
26	excited	null	Okay. Well I'm lying but-
27	null	null	Seriously, what's your major?
28	excited	null	Well, I haven't decided yet. I want to try some things out.
29	null	null	So you're undecided?
30	null	null	Hey, that's cool.
31	null	null	No, no. It's totally cool. I mean, like, this friend of mine he was- he's been undecided now for, like, the past like eleven years of his life.
32	excited	null	okay. Well I'm not going to be undecided forever. [LAUGHTER]
33	null	null	Uh, well-
34	excited	null	And it's so close so you can come visit me all the time.
35	null	null	You- you- you'll find.
36	excited	null	So this works out perfectly. Because I was worried if I didn't get in to U.S.C., then I would have to go somewhere far away and then-
37	null	null	You'd have to, like go somewhere else, and, you know, we would be apart, and that would suck.
38	excited	null	Everything worked out perfectly.
39	excited	null	That's awesome.
40	excited	null	I know. We should have a party.
41	excited	null	An I got accepted to U.S.C. party.
42	excited	null	No. An I got accepted to U.S.C. party. [LAUGHTER]
43	null	null	Oh, that's right. Okay, I see. Right, right, right.
44	null	null	A party celebrating your acceptance.
45	excited	null	Right. Now you're with me.
46	null	null	That's cool.
47	excited	null	That is why I got accepted.
48	excited	null	Well, that's really cool that you're going to be staying in the same city and everything. so umm
49	excited	null	I know.
50	null	null	I don't know are you, like, I don't know. Are you, like, available or anything?
51	excited	null	Well I mean I don't know. It's like you know I kind of had a crush on you throughout high school and, like
52	excited	null	I don't know I just thought that, you know, maybe we could, you know, I don't know. It's like, you know, just test the waters anyway. I don't see what the problem is.
53	excited	null	What- what did you have in mind?
54	excited	null	Movies- movie, we'll go to a movie and a dinner and- and
55	excited	null	actually, you know, there's this- there's this really cool restaurant, um, I don't know if you- it's Red Lobster. It's like down on
56	excited	null	[LAUGHTER]
57	excited	null	Vermont.
58	excited	null	Wait, you've been there before?
59	excited	null	On occasion I've heard of it.
60	excited	null	Oh, so well then you know that it's awesome.
61	excited	null	Yeah. Totally.
62	excited	null	Right, so we'll go there and then- and then we'll get some ice cream and maybe we'll go putt-putt golfing.
63	excited	null	I am totally down with the ice cream.
64	null	null	Okay. Putt-putt golfing?
65	excited	null	Eh, we can work that part out.
66	excited	null	Yeah, you want to go. No, you want to go. You want to go.
67	excited	null	Alright.
68	excited	null	I can see it in your eyes. You want to go.
69	excited	null	party.
70	excited	null	Good. Alright we're so happy.
71	excited	null	That's right. Um, so U.S.C. is a really nice school.
72	excited	null	I know.
73	null	null	Are you going to take out loans or-
74	excited	null	Okay well that's not a happy part. We don't want to talk about that.
75	excited	null	Well no. I mean I have some scholarships and some financial aid and stuff but I'll have to, you know, I'll get a job
76	excited	null	while I'm in school. It'll be good.
77	excited	null	Yeah. It will work out. Maybe I could work at Red Lobster.
78	excited	null	I know. Right down the street.
79	null	null	But, um-
80	null	null	I mean, like, I don't know. I'm just saying if you need to make some extra cash. You can, you know
81	null	null	Or library.
82	null	null	I just said the library
83	null	null	or, um, campus cruiser. You can drive people around.
84	excited	null	Excellent. Drive drunk people around because you know that's all campus cruisers for.
85	null	null	Right or you can run for student counsel.
86	excited	null	Okay. No, that's dorky.
87	null	null	Dorky?
88	excited	null	Yeah.
89	null	null	It's important.
90	excited	null	Student counsel?
91	excited	null	No, it's dorky.
92	null	null	Fine. It's dorky.
93	excited	null	Social life. Hello.
94	null	null	But that'll fit you because you're a dork.
95	excited	null	[LAUGHTER].
96	excited	null	[LAUGHTER].
97	excited	null	I dork.
98	excited	null	No. But I'm thinking I might, you know, like audition for a play or something. I don't really want to do the sorority thing. I'm not really feeling that vibe with the
99	null	null	Yeah, you don't want to do the sorority thing because you'll probably get used and abused by
100	null	null	lots of drunk frat boys
101	null	null	Yeah.
102	excited	null	What have you heard about the Greek system?
103	null	null	I mean it's not really free because you have to pay for it, but yeah.
104	null	null	Well do you think you're going to live on campus or off campus your first year?
105	null	null	I hate to break this to you but you meet people by being cool, so-
106	excited	null	Oh, oh, I'm sorry, my bad. I'll have to, like, sign up for summer lessons from you before I go. You can teach me how to be cool before I go to college.
107	null	null	No, no, no. You're right though. I mean, you know, dorms are definitely the way to meet people. I know that I was in an apartment off campus
108	null	null	that happened, you know, that was going on.
109	excited	null	That's what you're saying. I'm right. [LAUGHTER]
110	excited	null	me.

6	frustrated	null	Olivia Brown.
7	null	null	Alright Ms. Brown what's the nature of your problem?
8	frustrated	null	Well my phone isn't working and it hasn't been working for the last five days.
9	null	null	Oh. I'm sorry. Um- Did you drop it in water?
10	angry	null	Yeah, yeah, yeah you better be sorry.
11	angry	null	No I did not drop my phone in water. I'm not five years old and just dropped my phone anywhere I see it. Okay this is my business.
12	frustrated	null	Okay? And it [GARBAGE]. My business is failing because my phone isn't working and I don't have a land line and I really can't handle this right now.
13	null	null	Um- well it's probably easy. Can you any more symptoms either you're not receiving calls----ok, you're not receiving calls, not getting calls.

15	null	null	Is the phone turned on?
16	frustrated	null	Yes the phone turns on. No I mean I'm using it not turning on the phone. Of course it turns on.
17	null	null	Well, um- okay. Your sim card is in- didn't fall out-
18	frustrated	null	No- I don't have a sim card because it's Verizon and you guys don't use sim cards.
19	null	null	Alright. Um- Well that could be the problem. cause--
20	null	null	you might have an older phone where we would use sim cards but probably not.
21	frustrated	null	Okay no. Sir, this is the deal. My phone isn't working and I don't care what the problem is but it needs to work. That's why I'm paying you guys to fix it.
22	null	null	Okay. How about this we'll send you a brand new camera phone with palm pilot-- and-
23	frustrated	null	I don't know even how to use that stuff it's too complicated. I just want my flip phone to work----that's all I need
24	null	null	So we'll send it- And we'll give you, how about a free year's service?

2	null	null	She's been in New York three and a half years. Why all of the sudden?
3	null	null	Well maybe. Maybe she just wanted to see her again.
4	null	null	What did you mean? He lived next door to the girl all of his life, why wouldn't he want to see her again? Don't look at me like that, he didn't tell me any more than he told you.
5	frustrated	null	How do you know he is even thinking about it?
6	frustrated	null	Well, so what.
7	frustrated	null	What's going on here, Joe?
8	frustrated	null	Now, listen, Kate, just-
9	angry	null	She's not his girl. She knows she's not.
10	frustrated	null	She's . . . Then why is she still single. New York is full of men, why isn't she married? Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish, but she's waited.
11	frustrated	null	How do you know why she's waited?
12	frustrated	null	Because she knows what I know - she's faithful as a rock and my worst moments I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right.
13	frustrated	null	Look. It's a nice day. Why are we arguing?
14	frustrated	null	Nobody in her- this house dares shake her faith. Strangers might, but not his father, and not his brother.
15	frustrated	null	What do you want me to do? What do you want--
16	angry	null	I want you to pretend like he's coming back!
17	frustrated	null	But, Kate...
18	angry	null	Because if he's not coming back, then I'll kill myself.
19	frustrated	null	[LAUGHTER]
20	angry	null	Laugh. Laugh at me, but what happens the night that she goes to sleep in his bed, and his memorial breaks in pieces?
21	frustrated	null	Calm yourself.
22	frustrated	null	Calm yourself!
23	angry	null	Only last week, another boy turned up in Detroit, been missing longer than Larry, you read it yourself.
24	frustrated	null	All right, all right. Calm yourself.
25	sad	null	You've got to believe. You've got to--
26	angry	null	What do you mean me above all? Look at you. You're shaking!

3	null	null	I'll have a little, I think.
4	angry	null	I don't see why you want any you already had two glasses.
5	null	null	Oh, you know no particular reason besides they are very small glasses.
6	frustrated	null	Really, Amanda.
7	angry	null	Don't be stupid, what?
8	frustrated	null	Nothing.
9	null	null	Are you going out somewhere dear?
10	angry	null	Well it's a woman's duty to allure the man. Watch me a minute will you?
11	angry	null	You know, it's a pity you didn't have any more brandy. It would have made you just a little less disagreeable.
12	angry	null	You know what? You snap, you snap, you snap you're like a little adder.
13	angry	null	Nonsense. They have a bag of venom behind of fangs and they snap.
14	angry	null	They sting.
15	angry	null	I don't care. I don't care, do you understand? I don't mind if they bark and they roll about like hoops.
16	angry	null	Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?
17	angry	null	Yes, I did quite a lot.
18	angry	null	I suppose you let him just kiss you or good deal more than too.
19	angry	null	Oh, mind you own business.
20	angry	null	I suppose you two had a riotous time, huh? No restrain at all, very enjoyable, he never had much any how.
21	angry	null	You're quite insufferable, I expect it's because you're drunk.
22	angry	null	I am not in the least bit drunk.
23	angry	null	You always had a weak head.
24	angry	null	I think I told you once before that I had three minute liquor glasses the whole evening long. A Child of two cannot get drunk on that.
25	angry	null	On the contrary, a child two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.
26	angry	null	Oh very, very interesting Amanda. How about the child of uh... four, six or maybe nine---you know, we could work up a splendid little debate about it, you know? Intemperate tots.
27	angry	null	Shut up.
28	angry	null	Not very funny darling. Why don't you have some more brandy?
29	angry	null	That's a very good idea I think I will.
30	angry	null	Would you uh...turn that off please? You're going to wake the people upstairs.
31	angry	null	Why?
32	null	null	Well then you'll wake the people downstairs.
33	null	null	They are away in Tunis.
34	null	null	This is no time a year for Tunis.
35	null	null	Turn it on again, please.
36	null	null	I will do no such thing.
37	null	null	Very well if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.
38	null	null	Turn it off. It's driving me mad.
39	null	null	I won't.
40	null	null	Turn it off.
41	null	null	Stop it. No. Go away.
42	null	null	Amanda listen. Listen.
