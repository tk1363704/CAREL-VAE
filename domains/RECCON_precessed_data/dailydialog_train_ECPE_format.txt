2	happiness	null	Sounds like a good plan . What do you want to see ?
3	null	null	How about Legally Blonde .
4	null	null	Ah , my girlfriend wanted to see that movie . I have to take her later so I don't want to watch it ahead of time . How about The Cube ?

4	null	null	Oh , I think it is .
5	null	null	How come ?
6	anger	null	I think it's because of your bad habits !
7	null	null	I have no bad habit . I sleep eight hours a day , never eat spicy food , clean the face twice a day and so on . I have done a lot .
8	null	null	I know you have done a lot , but you always sleep very late . Sleeping eight hours a day doesn't mean it is healthy . Sleeping after 12 is hurtful to our body , and I think this is your problem .

7	null	null	why didn't you do a good job ?
8	null	null	I don't know . I sat down in my seat , looked at my paper , and then my mind just went totally blank .

7	null	null	Why ?
8	disgust	null	He's lazy . I tried being a good host , but if you give him an inch , he'll take a mile .
9	null	null	I guess you think twice next time he comes .
10	null	null	You can say that again .
11	null	null	So how long has he here for ?

3	null	null	I was at home with my parents in New York City .
4	null	null	really ? Did you see the hijacked planes crash into and destroy the twin towers ?
5	null	null	I didn't see the crash itself , but I did see the smoke and everything afterwards from my parents ' apartment building .
6	null	null	that must have been horrible . Did you go out at all that day to see what was going on ?
7	null	null	no , we decided to stay in our apartment . With all the buses out of service and the underground trains at a halt , many people had no choice but to walk home . It was utter chaos .
8	null	null	did you know anyone who worked in the World Trade Center ?
9	null	null	yes , my uncle's firm had an office in one of the towers .
10	null	null	did he survive ?
11	sadness	null	unfortunately , he wasn't able to evacuate in time . He ended up dying in the tower .
12	sadness	null	I'm sorry . That must have really been a nightmarish day for you and your family .
13	anger	null	it was . The hijackers didn't have any respect for human life not even their own .

4	null	null	My paper is on the influence of television on children .

3	null	null	He got arrested on Friday night and spent the night in jail .
4	surprise	null	No . Really , what happened ?
5	null	null	Well , it was all a big mistake , actually . He got home on Friday night really late , and apparently he'd been out drinking with some clients , so he was really drunk .
6	null	null	Was he out with the guys from the bank ?
7	null	null	Yes , I think so .
8	null	null	Oh , yeah , they always get really drunk .
9	null	null	Well , anyway , he'd somehow lost his wallet and his house keys , so he couldn't get in . He lives alone , you know .
10	surprise	null	Oh , really . I thought he lived with his wife .
11	null	null	No , she left him last year .
12	surprise	null	Oh , really ? Do you know why ?
13	null	null	Hang on , let me finish telling you what happened . Where was I ?
14	null	null	He lost his wallet and keys .
15	null	null	Oh yes , well , he tried to climb in through the bathroom window , but apparently he slipped and broke the glass with his foot . The neighbors heard him and thought a robbery was in progress , so they called the police .
16	null	null	Oh , no .
17	null	null	Yes . So when the cops arrived , they didn't believe his story
18	null	null	So then what happened ?
19	null	null	Well , when he sobered up , he called someone from work to come and bail him out .

4	happiness	null	That's true . Cycling is good for our environment , too . Let me just get my helmet then .
5	happiness	null	Is your helmet comfortable ?
6	happiness	null	Not really , but I liked the design , so I got it .
7	happiness	null	Maybe you should think about getting a round helmet ; they're better .
8	happiness	null	I'll think about it .
9	happiness	null	Is that your new bicycle ?
10	happiness	null	Yes , my father gave it to me for my birthday . Do you like it ?
11	happiness	null	It's the newest 10 speed cycling mountain bike . These are really expensive !
12	null	null	Nothing but the best from my dad . I like everything about it except for the brakes . They are a bit sticky .
13	null	null	I can fix those for you . Is there anything else wrong with it ?
14	null	null	Well , my saddle is too low for me . Do you know how to change the height ?
15	null	null	That's easy . It's important to have the saddle high enough so that your legs can extend fully when you are on your bicycle .
16	null	null	Is that why my knees have felt sore after every time I've ridden my bike ?
17	null	null	It's possible . Give me a minute and I can fix these for you and then we can go .

5	anger	null	I don ' t slurp my coffee . And plus , how can you hear it when you ' re shouting into your phone all the time ?

7	null	null	Look , we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions , and it ' s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . But , it ' s probably not a good idea to keep it up I ' m willing to forgive and forget and if you are .
8	null	null	Fine . Let's call a truce . I'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down .

4	surprise	null	No , it can't be . Really ? Who ?
5	fear	null	I don't know . I saw him the first time Tuesday . He was at the cafe . I noticed he was looking at me a lot . Not just the usual looking , but staring . He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop .
6	null	null	What did you do ?
7	fear	null	I didn't do anything . Finally , he left . But then I saw him again today . Outside the shoe store . Near the cafe . I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's . But then he came in too .
8	null	null	Did he leave when you left ?
9	null	null	Yes . Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . He was following me .
10	null	null	What did you do ?
11	fear	null	He followed me all the way home !
12	null	null	That's about five blocks . And around corners too . So he was definitely following you .
13	fear	null	Yes , he was . I'm not imagining it . Finally , just when I got home , I turned around and looked at him . He was just standing there . He didn't smile . He just stood there . It was so obvious . What should I do ? I'm so scared . Can I call the police ?
14	null	null	Actually , I don't think you can call the police . Not yet at least . He hasn't done anything . And probably the police will just ignore it . But if anything happens again , then maybe you should call .
15	fear	null	Why can't I call the police now ? He was definitely following me !
16	null	null	Of course you can call the police if you want . That's not what I mean . I'm just saying that they probably won't do anything .
17	null	null	I suppose . What can they do ? I don't even know who he is .
18	null	null	Listen , Carol . Don't let this bother you too much . Probably it's nothing . Just keep your eyes open when you go out . If you see him a third time , and if he follows you again , then I think we should go to the police . But for now , just try not to worry .
19	null	null	Alright . And I won't go to that cafe for awhile .

5	null	null	Why ? What happened ?

7	null	null	That's not very fair . What did you do ?
8	disgust	null	There wasn't really anything that I could do . There's always been a lot of bad blood between my manager and myself . If I had said anything , he would have fired me for sure .
9	null	null	Does he treat everyone in your department like this ?
10	anger	null	He treats everyone pretty badly , but the way he treats me really takes the cake !
11	null	null	Do you have any idea why he treats you worse than the others ?
12	anger	null	I really have no idea . All I know is that the thought of him really curls my hair !
13	null	null	Is there anyone else you can talk to about it at your company ?
14	null	null	Not really . I'm hoping to live with it for a while until I get a promotion .
15	null	null	That's very sensible . It sounds like you have a good head on your shoulders .
16	null	null	I try to be sensible about it , but it's not very easy . Sometimes you just have to grin and bear it .

10	null	null	I can't consider you as a little kid any more . I know he is very tall .
11	null	null	Oh , you know something . He is 2 . 26 meters tall . But he is also nimble and skillful .
12	null	null	I also heard if a player has committed 5 fouls then he must be out of the game .
13	null	null	Yes , what's worse is he can't take any further part in the game .

1	null	null	What should I get Uncle Teddy ?
2	null	null	You could get him a tie .
3	surprise	null	Are you kidding ? That's the stupidest gift one can buy . I don't want to get a tie .
4	null	null	Why not ?
5	null	null	Everybody gets men ties for Christmas . It's too boring . Everybody buys either ties or sweaters . I want a more unique gift .
6	null	null	Well , you can buy him a pet iguana then .
7	happiness	null	That's a cool idea . At least it would be a surprise . But I'm afraid he wouldn't take care of it .
8	null	null	He would think you were crazy , Caroline .
9	null	null	Yes . An iguana is too strange for a gift , and a tie is too normal . So I have to find something halfway between .
10	null	null	How much do you want to spend ?
11	null	null	Well , he was very good to me . He helped me edit my essay for the scholarship contest . So I want to spend at least 75 dollars .
12	null	null	Alright , I have an idea . You know he carries that conservative-looking briefcase every day .
13	null	null	Yes .
14	null	null	Well , he isn't a lawyer , so I don't think he needs to have a briefcase like that .
15	null	null	What should he have then ?
16	null	null	I think he would appreciate having a very fine leather bag . But more like a workbag or shoulder bag . You know , not so hard and square like a briefcase .
17	happiness	null	I think that's a great idea . Men look great with that kind of bag . Where can we buy one ?
18	null	null	I don't think this mall has a leather goods store . So we have to go to State Street .
19	null	null	Alright . We can go later then .
20	null	null	We can buy something for Mom and Dad here , and then go buy Uncle Teddy's gift on State Street .
21	happiness	null	Good plan . What should we get for Mom though ?
22	null	null	She said she wants one of those automatic foot massagers . I think they sell them at Sears .
23	null	null	Alright . We can go check at Sears and see if they have them . And what about Dad ?
24	null	null	How about the iguana ?
25	null	null	I think it would be a great joke . But I know we'd have to take the iguana back . And the pet store might not let us . So why don't we get him something else ? Some clothes maybe .
26	null	null	A tie ?
27	anger	null	Oh , shut up about ties ! Forget about ties , why not ?
28	null	null	I was just kidding .

2	null	null	What ? What did you buy ?
3	anger	null	It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it !
4	null	null	What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ?
5	null	null	There was a guy on the sidewalk . He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes . He said he had to get rid of them quick .
6	null	null	And ?
7	null	null	So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks .
8	null	null	And it's a brick ?
9	null	null	Yes .
10	surprise	null	I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ?
11	null	null	I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store . If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new .
12	null	null	So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic .
13	null	null	Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products . Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new .
14	surprise	null	But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ?
15	null	null	He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen .
16	null	null	Aha ! Now I understand . You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk . So , what I think is , you deserve to get cheated !
17	null	null	C'mon , don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it . We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box .
18	null	null	That's no problem . He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy . And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from . Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there . Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around . So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you . Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks .
19	null	null	You're right , Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ?

5	null	null	For example ?
6	null	null	Well , last week I invited her over to dinner . My husband and I had no problem with the food , but if you listened to her , then it would seem like I fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . There's just nothing can please her .
7	null	null	No , I can't see that happening . I know you're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen .
8	null	null	It's not just that . She also criticizes how we raise the kids .
9	null	null	My mother-in-law used to do the same thing to us . If it wasn't disciplining them enough , then we were disciplining them too much . She also complained about the food we fed them , the schools we sent them too , and everything else under the sun .
10	null	null	You said she used to ? How did you stop her ?

6	null	null	So you're a big fan , eh ?
7	null	null	Not really . But I like some of her songs . She's actually very talented . She's a song writer and fashion designer , too .
8	null	null	And she was in a movie once again , right ?
9	null	null	Yeah , though I don't think her acting skills are that great .
10	null	null	What was your impression of her when you saw her in person ?
11	null	null	She looked sweeter than her pictures .
12	null	null	Did you take a photo with her ?

1	anger	null	Oh , my God ! I've been cheated !
2	surprise	null	What ? What did you buy ?
3	anger	null	It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it !
4	null	null	What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ?
5	anger	null	There was a guy on the sidewalk . He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes . He said he had to get rid of them quick .
6	null	null	And ?
7	null	null	So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks .
8	null	null	And it's a brick ?
9	null	null	Yes .
10	surprise	null	I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ?
11	null	null	I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store . If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new .
12	null	null	So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic .
13	null	null	Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products . Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new .
14	null	null	But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ?
15	null	null	He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen .
16	null	null	Aha ! Now I understand . You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk . So , what I think is , you deserve to get cheated !
17	null	null	C'mon , don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it . We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box .
18	null	null	That's no problem . He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy . And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from . Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there . Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around . So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you . Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks .
19	null	null	You're right , Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ?

1	null	null	So , Monica , what do you feel like doing this afternoon ?
2	disgust	null	Actually , I had a perfect plan for this afternoon , but it is totally ruined by the sand storm . I woke up this morning and found it was sunny . So I called Lucy and asked her to go shopping with me . We were going to look for a new purse . Now it turned out to be like this . Neither of us wants to go to outside anymore .
3	disgust	null	That ' s too bad . I hate sand storms too . It can be worse than any kind of bad weather .
4	disgust	null	What ' s wrong with climate ? Anyway , I think the sand storm happens more frequently these days than the years before . Can ' t people do something to stop it ?
5	null	null	It is not an easy job . The government is working on it . Lots of trees have been planted in the north of the capital . Also , methods of generating rain are being used by the government to fight against the drought . But of course , it will not work overnight . So , have you come out with a new plan for today ?
6	null	null	My new plan is to wait for the end of the sand storm and clean my apartment .

2	happiness	null	I'd love to . I heard about Halloween when I was in Beijing . It's kind of a children's day . Small kids get dressed up , then walk around with paper bags or baskets , knocking on the neighbor's
3	null	null	They are supposed to say trick or treat ? Then the neighbors are supposed to hand up the candy .
4	happiness	null	That's kind of cool . But what's the trick mean ?
5	null	null	Usually it's the older kids going around playing Halloween , like punching the pumpkins left outside people's doors or - - someone's tree . They usually do it late at night after little kids go
6	happiness	null	That sounds kind of fun , maybe I can get tighter with my friends that night .

2	null	null	Well . I like them a little heavier . I don't have as much control , usually bowling straight , but the extra momentum compensates for that .
3	happiness	null	Well , let's see which technique is better . I think I'll go up first ... Yes ! I hit a strike . I knocked them all down on my first bowl .
4	happiness	null	Well done . You got them all . You get 10 points and your next two bowls are added to this frame's score . I'II dry my ball off and try to knock them all down as well .
5	happiness	null	Good start . You knocked eight pins down . But you are left with a 7,10 split . Unless you can bowl a UFO-ball on this bowl , it is going to be impossible .
6	happiness	null	I certainly can try ... No ! It went straight through the wickets .

1	surprise	null	I can ' t believe my English teacher is making me read pride and prejudice !
2	surprise	null	Why not ! It ' s a classic ; in fact , it ' s one of my favorite novels .
3	null	null	But it ' s so old .
4	null	null	Don ' t judge a book by its cover . Do you Kwon what it ' s about ?
5	null	null	No , not at all .
6	null	null	First of all , it ' s a romance novel , set in the early 19th century .
7	null	null	I didn ' t realize it was a romance novel . What ' s the main storyline ?
8	null	null	It ' s basically about a father who tried to marry off one of his five girls .
9	null	null	Why does he want to do that ?
10	null	null	Since he doesn ' t have a son , he hopes that one of the girls will marry a wealthy man . That way , all of his daughters will be cared for .
11	null	null	Won ' t they get his inheritance ?
12	null	null	No , that ' s the problem . Though they are well-off , once he dies , his house will go to his cousin . So , when he dies , the girls will have nothing .
13	happiness	null	I see . This sounds interesting ! Maybe my teacher isn ' t so horrible after all .
14	null	null	So , are you going to read the novel or watch the movie ?
15	surprise	null	There ' s movie ? My teacher didn ' t tell me that !
16	null	null	That ' s probably because she wants you to read the book first .

2	surprise	null	What ? Why do we have to do that ?
3	null	null	Well , at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon . This is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth . In any case , to take better advantage of the daylight available , we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour .
4	anger	null	I see . That ' s convenient ! I never understood things like this , such as GMT . I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock !
5	null	null	That just stands for Greenwich Mean Time . Here in California , we are in Pacific Standard Time , that is eight time zones west of Greenwich . Remember when we were in Beijing ? Well , then we were in China Standard Time , and that ' s eight time zones east of Greenwich !
6	surprised	null	That ' s why it was so weird traveling from Beijing to LA ! Because of the huge time difference , even though we left Beijing at noon and flew for more than eight hours , we still arrived in LA the same day at noon ! It ' s like we went back in time !

7	null	null	Four hundred ?
8	null	null	No need to sweat it . My parents agreed to pay for most of the wedding , which is going to be low-budget anyway .

9	null	null	Ah ...
10	null	null	And then of course the ladies at the church would love to be our caterers for the banquet and we ' ll get the Youth Group to serve us . I was thinking that your friend ' s band could be our entertainment for the night . though they might have to tone it down a bit . Or we could hire a DJ . Your sister ' s husband could get us a discount with that company that does the decor at weddings . what ' s their name again ? I was thinking that we could have an island paradise-themed wedding and our theme color would be a soothing blue like Aquamarine . And there will be a huge seashell on the wall behind the podium where we ' ll make our toasts ! What do you think of small packages of drink mixes for our wedding favors ? Who else am I missing ? Oh , your uncle could be our florist and his wife could make our wedding cake !
11	null	null	Wow .

5	null	null	Yeah , it can get pretty lonely over the holidays . When I first got here , I ' d get depressed and nostalgic for anything that reminded me of home . I almost let it get to me , but then I started going out , keeping myself busy and before I knew it , I was used to to it .
6	sadness	null	I see what you mean , but I ' m still bummed out .
7	null	null	OK . how does this sound . let ' s get you suited up and hit the dance club tonight . I hear that an awesome DJ is playing and there will be a lot of pretty single girls there !
8	happiness	null	You know , I could really go for that . You don ' t mind being my wingman for tonight ?
9	null	null	Not at all ! It be fun ! It will be like a boys ' night out ... well kinda ...

5	happiness	null	That's exciting , man .
6	null	null	So how did you propose ?
7	null	null	You shouldn't use my example . It wasn't special . I kind of wish I made it more special but it's too late now .
8	null	null	What do you think I should do ?
9	null	null	There are a lot of options . You can surprise her over dinner , or ask her in a public area , or if you have the balls , ask her father in front of her .
10	null	null	I never thought about that .
11	null	null	Thought about what ?
12	null	null	Asking her father in front of her . How do you think she will react ?
13	null	null	I don't know . You should know how she's going to react . She is your girlfriend .

9	null	null	Where can find the pandas ? I think we are here to see the pandas .
10	null	null	We have to go to the mammal area . We are at the gate right now . We need to go straight from here and turn left and go along to the end and make anotherleft turn .

3	happiness	null	It's great . I really get to focus on what I like to do and everyone has been very nice and welcoming . However , I'm having a small problem with my new colleagues .
4	null	null	What happened ?
5	null	null	Well , three people are celebrating their birthdays this month and the policy here is for everyone to contribute ten dollars to a card and cake for each person .
6	happiness	null	Wow , so you'll be out thirty dollars on your first week at work !
7	null	null	I know . It is a lot of money and I haven't gotten to know any of the people celebrating their birthdays well enough yet . At our old department , it was only three dollars for each birthday and there were only ten of us .
8	null	null	Well , every department is different . You wouldn't want your new co-workers to think you're a Grinch , right ?
9	null	null	What is that ?
10	null	null	A Grinch is a person who spoils the mood at a happy occasion by being selfish or unenthusiastic . You know - a party proper .
11	null	null	I definitely don't want to be that ! But , I still think it's unreasonable for them to ask me for such a big sum of money when we don't know each other very well . What should I do ?

8	sadness	null	Better or worse , it doesn't matter . I had a lot of feelings for him . I really liked him
9	null	null	It must be really painful . I remember when Josh and I broke up . I was crying for a week .
10	sadness	null	I know . I'll get over him . My first break up was painful because I was naive .
11	null	null	Exactly . You'll find someone again . You should get your mind off of this . Let's go shopping .

6	null	null	I have fewer hobbies than yours . That's why I find campus life a bit dull and uninteresting .
7	happiness	null	Oh , you can't think like that . We young people should try our best to learn new things and accept new ideas . You like taking photos and going to photography shows , why not practise the technique and catch something unforgeable ?
8	happiness	null	That's a good suggestion . It's fine today . Maybe I can take photos on the scenery of the lake at sunset . It must be fantastic .

10	null	null	Sure . What can you choose from ?
11	null	null	Well , I have to take all the fundamental course , plus a few from my major .
12	null	null	What is your major ?
13	null	null	I hope to major in English literature , but the admissions counselor told me that many people change their major many times in their first year , so we ' ll see .
14	null	null	What are the fundamental course ?
15	null	null	In order to graduate , every student must take a certain amount of classes in history , math , English , philosophy , science and art .

17	null	null	Yes , it is . It ' s also very different from the British education system .

4	null	null	Have you ever written up a business plan before ?
5	anger	null	Well , no . it can ' t be that hard ! I mean , all you have to do is explain your business , how you are going to do things and that ' s it , right ?
6	null	null	You couldn ' t be more wrong ! A well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . Then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has , history , etc .
7	null	null	Well , that seems easy enough .
8	null	null	Wait , there ' s more ! Then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . What they are and how they are different from competitors ' ? Then comes the hard part , a market analysis . You need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables ! You need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from GDP per capita to how many children on average the population has ! All this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage , where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea .
9	null	null	Geez . Is that all ?
10	null	null	Almost , the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . Here you will calculate and estimate sales , cash flow and profits . After all , people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !
11	happiness	null	Umm . I think I ' ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !

2	null	null	Tell me about it . If I was as small as her , I wouldn't think about going on a diet .
3	null	null	Me too . But what are we going to do ? I have been on 4 different diets and I can't seem to lose weight .
4	null	null	That's because you don't exercise . If you were more active , you wouldn't have a dieting problem .
5	null	null	What do you know ? You are over weight too .
6	null	null	I'm not on a diet though .
7	null	null	I know . But I don't have someone to diet with . If we help each other and motivate each other , then I think we can lose some weight .
8	null	null	I like ice cream too much though .
9	null	null	C'mon . You'll feel better and look better and as a reward you can eat a little bit of ice cream here and there .
10	null	null	It does sound appealing .
11	happiness	null	It's a great idea . I can't believe I didn't think of this earlier . Going on a diet with a friend to back you up is a great way to succeed .

13	happiness	null	Great . I'll get our plan started right away .

5	happiness	null	I've always wanted to go to Paris . The Eiffel Tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! Did you go to the top ?
6	happiness	null	That was the first thing we did . I have a few pictures . Do you want to see them ?
7	null	null	Sure . What's this one a picture of ?

11	null	null	So what did you do ?
12	happiness	null	We spent that afternoon walking around a flea market . We had a few coffees , watched a movie , and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel .
13	happiness	null	My travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . Did you go to the Louvre ?
14	happiness	null	Of course ! You can't go to Paris without going to their famous art gallery ! I was surprised by how small the Mona Lisa was though .

2	null	null	Don ' t worry . I don't think you ' re going to lose your job over one mistake .
3	null	null	It was a rather big mistake . When you work as an investment adviser , one small mistake can cost the company millions .
4	null	null	But it wasn ' t just you who was involved , right ? You were only doing what your supervisor told you to do .
5	null	null	That ' s true , but my supervisor is very dishonest . There ' s no reason he needs to tell our boss the truth . I ' m sure he will tell our boss that it was all my fault , and there ' s nothing I can do about that . My boss won ' t believe me if I tell him the truth .
6	null	null	Let ' s think realistically about what might happen . How much money do you have in your savings ?
7	null	null	I have enough to live off of for about 3 months . But I really don't want to spend my life savings on just living ! I ' d rather invest my money somehow .
8	null	null	Well , you can't have everything . Let's just figure out what you will do if you lose your job . When is your contract up on your apartment ?
9	null	null	Next month . So I can either move out then or renew my contract for another year .
10	happiness	null	Well , that ' s good . If you lose your job , you can just move in with me until you find another job . That will save you plenty of money .
11	happiness	null	That ' s very generous of you . I guess that would work .
12	happiness	null	If you lose your job , you just have to go for a few months without buying all the junk you usually buy . If you live frugally , you ' ll save plenty of money .
13	happiness	null	I guess working with so much money has made me rather greedy . Maybe losing my job would be a good thing !

3	happiness	null	We've never sold this much before , our growth this year has been phenomenal . We have captured 8 % of the market , up from last year by 120 % . Our strategy is working !
4	happiness	null	not only our annual sales brake a record , but our month by month earnings exceeded our forecast as well . After a two-year slump , we finally back in the black .
5	null	null	The company's performance has improved since Wallace became president . He's made our little business into a real lucrative operation . Products are selling like hotcakes .
6	null	null	I think our success is partly because of Wallace's contribution , and partly because of our new marketing strategy . Because of the new advertising campaign , we have become the top sellers in the field .

3	disgust	null	He constantly lets inappropriate things slip out , referring to the women employees as girls or calling us sweetheart or darling . I doubt any of my male colleagues would stand for such treatment .
4	null	null	Don ' t you think you are overreacting a little ? Calling you by nicknames shouldn ' t be so bad ...
5	disgust	null	You ' re missing the point . It ' s about respect . He treats us with such a patronizing attitude , as if we are not equal or not as serious as our male co-workers . It ' s his attitude that needs to be changed , not just his words .
6	null	null	That ' s what you get for working in a male-dominated field . I think you ' ll find that most male bosses in your industry are already conditioned to treat females in this way . You probably won ' t be able to change him .

6	anger	null	You ' Ve got to be kidding me ! You ' re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?
7	null	null	Look , we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions , and it ' s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . But , it ' s probably not a good idea to keep it up I ' m willing to forgive and forget and if you are .

13	happiness	null	The gown is quite expensive , believe me .
14	disgust	null	So what ? It only makes her look cheap and vulgar .
15	happiness	null	You know those upstarts . They're all show-offs ! I think I'd better have a diet ; otherwise I'd look like a ballon soon .

4	null	null	how did the business trip go ?
5	disgust	null	well , to be honest , nothing is more stressful than going on a business trip with our boss .
6	null	null	I understand . The last time I went on a business trip with the boss , I didn't even have enough to eat !
7	null	null	I also think the company is pretty cheap with travel expenses . I spent half of the weekend on a train ! Surely they could have afforded to buy a few plane tickets !

5	happiness	null	Cool ! It must be amazing to work at a bar !
6	null	null	Yeah , but I ' m not there for fun . I have to remain professional and if I get distracted , the manager would be pretty upset .
7	null	null	That ' s true . I ' m wondering did you learn anything from the job ?
8	null	null	Of course . There ' s always much to learn . I got to know more about the real world .
9	null	null	You mean you got working experience , right ?
10	null	null	Not just working experience . I would say the biggest lesson I learned is how to deal with people from all walks of life .

7	happiness	null	I really like that restaurant ; you get a lot for your money there . But , they've westernized their food , so it's not actually that spicy .
8	happiness	null	You're right . Most of their dishes have sweet sauces . We could try that Indian restaurant just down the road from us .
9	happiness	null	The Taj ? They're a bit expensive , but they do serve large portions of very hot food .

11	happiness	null	Shall we bring our own bottle of wine to save some money ?

5	null	null	January 5th .

7	null	null	That ' s bogus . I don't feel any stress at work , and my love life is practically nonexistent . This zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense .
8	null	null	No , it ' s not , your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality . See ? It says that an Aries is energetic and loves to socialize .
9	null	null	Well , you certainly match those criteria , but they ' re so broad they could apply to anyone . What does it say about me ?

2	null	null	Well , George . I guess I am . Why do you ask ?
3	null	null	I've just gotten a pair of pre-sale Star Wars movie tickets from a friend and was thinking of inviting you along for the opening premiere . Are you interested ?
4	happiness	null	Yeah , definitely ! Thanks for inviting me .
5	happiness	null	My pleasure .
6	null	null	I really wanted to watch the Star Wars on the opening day , but the pre-sale tickets were sold out . How did you manage to get hold of them ?
7	null	null	A friend of mine works at the corporate headquarters of Pepsi , which is a major sponsor of the movie . He was able to get the tickets for free , and then he sold two more for me for 50 dollars a piece .
8	surprise	null	You paid 50 dollars for each ticket ? That's a huge premium over the regular price .
9	null	null	Not really . Considering the fact that other people were willing to pay as much as 200 dollars each on the black market . Besides , I knew you were really looking forward to watching Star Wars on the opening day .
10	happiness	null	Wow ! I am really honored you went through all this trouble just for my sake . I really appreciate that . So , what time are we going ?
11	null	null	Well , let's see . The movie stars at 10 . We should be there at least 1 hour earlier , because there is a big line . I could pick you up at your house at 8 , if that's ok with you .
12	null	null	8 pm , that's fine with me .
13	null	null	Okay .
14	null	null	So I'll see you tomorrow then at 8 .
15	null	null	Yeah , that's great . I'll see you tomorrow night .
16	null	null	Ok , George . Bye !
17	null	null	Bye , Ann !

5	happiness	null	I ' m glad they ' re coming in August . Maybe Greg and I can play some golf or get tickets to a baseball game .
6	happiness	null	And Margaret and I can take the dog and go jogging in the park .
7	happiness	null	Remember the garden party they gave when we were in England ?
8	happiness	null	Oh , yes . We all sat on the grass , and Margaret played the guitar and sang Greek songs .

2	happiness	null	I'm glad to help you . What's wrong ?
3	sadness	null	My mother-in-law just went into the hospital in L . A . Hank and I will be flying there tonight .
4	sadness	null	I'm sorry to hear it . What's wrong with her ?
5	null	null	Doctors aren't sure yet . But the real problem is Suzy . She has a bad cold , and we don't want to take her with us . But we don't know who can stay with her .
6	null	null	You need a babysitter .
7	null	null	Yes , I'd ask Jill , the girl I've had before , but I need someone overnight . Maybe even for two nights .
8	null	null	I could have Suzy stay at my place .
9	null	null	I don't want to do that to you , Karen .
10	null	null	Why not ?
11	null	null	Your own kids would get Suzy's cold . I think it would be better to have a good babysitter here . But I don't know who to ask . I need someone more mature than Jill . It might even be for two or three days .
12	null	null	I know who we can ask . There is a girl I know , Sara Ralston . She is 17 , and she will usually take this kind of job . I know her from my church , and I trust her completely .
13	null	null	I'd like to talk with her . This is short notice , I know . But Hank and I are leaving tonight .
14	null	null	I'll get you her number . I hope she can do it . She is very responsible .
15	happiness	null	I'm glad you know someone . I knew you would be the best person to ask about this . I don't want to insult Jill or her mother . I think Jill maybe could do it . But I'd rather have someone a little older .
16	null	null	I'll go home and get Sara's number . I'll call her first myself .
17	happiness	null	Great . Then call me and let me know if she's free .

4	null	null	Well , I want to build a deck in my back yard .
5	null	null	What for ?
6	null	null	So I can have a special place to hang out with friends , and also do some barbecuing on weekends .
7	happiness	null	That sounds cool . Do you mind if I recommend myself for the job ?
8	surprise	null	You ? Do you have a carpenter's license ?
9	happiness	null	Yes , of course . But I only freelance on weekends with my uncle .
10	surprise	null	Wow ! That's cool . So , let me give you some details about the deck I want .
11	happiness	null	Please go ahead , I am listening .
12	null	null	I'd like my deck to be at the same level as the back door .
13	null	null	Is your back door higher than the ground level ?
14	null	null	Yes , the back door is about four or five steps higher than the ground .
15	null	null	Okay , then you need a deck with a guardrail .
16	null	null	I don't like things to be fancy .
17	happiness	null	Don't worry . I will build your deck with a simple but classic look .
18	happiness	null	Hmm , that's good . Can you use cedar or redwood to build it ?
19	happiness	null	Cedar is a good choice .
20	happiness	null	Well , let's take the measurements right now .

9	null	null	That's a long time .
10	null	null	Yeah , I started to learn English when I was in high school .
11	happiness	null	No wonder your English is so good .
12	happiness	null	Actually , it's not that good . I can read but I can't speak very well . I haven't had a lot of chance to practice .
13	happiness	null	I see . Talking with other people is very important .

8	sadness	null	His excuse was familiar . He said his car died again .
9	null	null	I think that's a bunch of nonsense . It seemed ok to me .
10	sadness	null	I know . Last week he gave me a lie about being too busy .
11	null	null	Doesn't sound promising .

1	anger	null	I've something very unpleasant to talk with you . Upon the arrival of the first consignment , it was found that about 50 % of the sixty cases of pineapples were leaking .
2	null	null	It's rather an unusual case . Have you found the cause of leaking ?
3	anger	null	It ' s simply because the tins were damaged .
4	null	null	It appears to be the only case to us , that the goods have been damaged on the way .
5	anger	null	I am sorry to say it's not on the way , but during loading . The tins inside the cases were broken evidently through rough handling .
6	null	null	Could you offer us a certificate issued by your Health Department ?
7	null	null	Certainly . Here you are . Our health authorities said they were no longer suitable for human consumption . I have to remind you that our terms are CIF Hamburg . I hope you would indemnify us for the loss , so it wouldn't be so heavy on us .

2	null	null	Why ? What are they like ?
3	anger	null	They're incredibly selfish . They ' re always up until the wee hours of the night playing their music so loudly that I have to wear earplugs in order to fall asleep !
4	null	null	Have you ever talked to them about it ?
5	anger	null	I tried to introduce myself to them when they moved in , but they were so arrogant that I didin't want to ever talk to them again !
6	null	null	What did they say ?
7	anger	null	They both just talk about how great they are all the time .
8	anger	null	They soud like the neighbours from hell !
9	anger	null	They are ! Besides being loud and arrogant , they're also terrible gossips . They're always talking about everybody else in the apartment .
10	null	null	I thought you didn't talk to them much .
11	null	null	I don't , but they talk so loudly that I can hear what they're talking about from my bedroom - and it's not very nice .
12	null	null	What do the other people in your apartment think about them ?
13	null	null	Most of my other neighbours are scared of them .
14	null	null	Maybe you should think about moving .
15	disgust	null	I can't afford to move right now .
16	null	null	Well , perhaps you should have a party and try to get to know them better . Maybe once you get to know them , they'll turn out to be more sensitive .
17	disgust	null	I think you're being a bit optimistic . If you met them , you'd understand .

4	null	null	Have you found anything yet ?
5	null	null	You know how hard it is to find a decent place at this time of year ?
6	null	null	You should be able to find something comfortable in town , though that would be kind of far from school .

1	null	null	What's the bonus like at your company ?
2	null	null	Well , it's OK , I suppose . We get about the equivalent of six months ' salary .
3	surprise	null	Six months ' salary ? Are you serious ? That's incredible !
4	null	null	Maybe . But you'd be amazed at how little's left after the credit companies have deducted their share from my account .
5	null	null	Hey , I know what that's like . I bought a BMW on my Visa card . Now the payments really hurt .
6	null	null	Well , you're lucky that you're still able to make your payments . I missed a credit payment last month . Now my bank account's overdrawn , and the company is threatening to take back my purchases .
7	null	null	What did you buy ?
8	null	null	A new home health monitor .
9	surprise	null	Health Monitor ? I read an article about that racket . They ' re overpriced to begin with ! Listen , if I were you , I'd let them take back their monitor and spend my money on something more practical .
10	surprise	null	You're kidding !
11	null	null	No joke !
12	null	null	That's something else ! Maybe I'll return it to them .

2	null	null	I'm going out this Saturday .
3	null	null	Do you already have a foursome ?
4	null	null	Unfortunately , we do . Let's plan for something together for Wednesday . We can go right after work .
5	null	null	That sounds good . Where do you want to play ?
6	null	null	We won't have much time , so let's play somewhere close to work .
7	null	null	How about Bellevue ? It's pretty close .
8	null	null	How much does it cost over there ?
9	null	null	Twilight rates are 21 dollars .
10	happiness	null	That's pretty good . Let's do it .

1	null	null	I like the Honda Accord you showed me before . I think it's more practical for my needs .
2	happiness	null	Alright , sir . You are making a good choice . Honda has made a lot of design improvements in the new Accord .
3	null	null	What does it come with standard ?
4	null	null	On all our new cars , the standards includeair conditioning , anti-lock brakes , air bags , and an AM / FM stereo with a CD player . But on the Accord , there is another standard item as well . The Accord com
5	null	null	Cruise control ? I don't like that .
6	surprise	null	Why not , sir ?
7	null	null	I think it's dangerous . What if I can't turn it off ?
8	null	null	Well , sir , I know some of our customers are concerned about cruise control . But Honda has never had a single cruise control malfunction that led to an accident .
9	null	null	I wish it didn't have cruise control . My wife doesn't like it either .
10	null	null	You know , sir , you don't have to use it . You can turn it on or off . If you don't want to use it , you just never turn it on .
11	null	null	I suppose . And what about the sunroof ? Is that standard ?
12	null	null	No , the sunroof is optional , sir .
13	null	null	I see . Another important question is the time I can get this car . I need a new car rather soon .
14	null	null	Well , I can say that the new models will be here in August . If you order one now , we will have it for you in August .
15	happiness	null	That's good enough , I think . What colors does the new Accord come in ?
16	null	null	We have this new model in red , white , black , or silver . These are the standard colors . Of course you could specially order from various other colors too .
17	null	null	My brother has last year's Accord . And his car is a kind of soft purple color mixed with silver . I really like that color . I wonder if I can get that color on my Accord .
18	null	null	I know the color you mean . Is this it , sir ?
19	null	null	Yes , I think that's it . Can I get that on the Accord ?
20	null	null	Yes , you can . That color is very popular with Honda buyers . So we've kept it available .
21	happiness	null	Well , I think I want to order the new Accord then . It looks like an excellent car .
22	happiness	null	You have made a good choice , sir . I drive an Accord myself . They are very solidly built machines , very reliable .
23	null	null	Yes , I know . I think Honda is the most reliable car on the road . I would never change to anything else . The Honda I have now almost never has service problems . It runs smooth as silk .
24	null	null	Alright , sir . I will get the paperwork ready for you . Just a moment .

1	null	null	Hello everyone , and welcome to our CPR for beginners course . First of all , does anyone know what CPR stands for ?
2	happiness	null	Cardiopulmonary resuscitation !
3	null	null	That ' s right ! We apply CPR in the case of cardiac arrest or pulmonary arrest .
4	null	null	What does that mean ?
5	null	null	Well , basically if your heart stops pumping blood , or your lungs stop pumping air , then we need to get them going again ! That ' s when we have to apply this procedure . Let ' s begin ! I need a volunteer .
6	excited	null	Me ! Me !
7	null	null	Alright , come here and lay flat on your back . Let ' s suppose this young woman has stopped breathing . We must lift the person ' s chin so that we clear a pathway for air to get into the lungs . Then we place our mouth over the other person ' s mouth and blow air two or three times , like this .
8	surprise	null	Wait , what are you doing ? I ' m a married woman ! You can ' t just try to kiss me like this !
9	null	null	Madam I ' m not trying to kiss you ! I am trying to demonstrate how to apply CPR in the case of an emergency .
10	null	null	Well , OK . But no French kissing !
11	null	null	As I was saying , we blow air through the mouth in this manner . Once this is done , we must try to get the heart going again . To do this , we place our hands over the person ' s chest , and press down firmly two or three times .
12	surprise	null	Wait , what are you doing ! You can ' t just kiss me then go for second base !

7	null	null	Mm , so what are you going to miss about Japan ?
8	null	null	Oh , I am going to miss the people , the food , the night life . Especially the nightlife .
9	null	null	What especially about the night life are you going to miss ?
10	null	null	Well , I really like dancing . And I enjoy going out to night clubs and to restaurants and eating Japanese food also and I'm really going to miss that because it's very different to London .
11	null	null	How are the clubs different in Japan than in London ?
12	null	null	Well , here there are many different clubs you can get into , for free , you don't have to pay , some of them . In London it's really expensive for drinks and an entry fee .

5	null	null	He got arrested all right .
6	disgust	null	If I remember , he got off with a light sentence . Something like three years in a minimum-security prison .
7	disgust	null	Yup , that ' s him . He made millions of dollars selling bonds to people and ended up with a pile of cash when they became useless .
8	disgust	null	I think the government fined him a small amount , and he kept the rest in his foreign bank accounts . He ' s still a millionaire .
9	disgust	null	That ' s the kind of thing in America that gets me mad . Some guy pulls off a stock scheme and makes millions while spending the bare minimum sentence in jail .

4	sadness	null	She said it was because we had very different ideas about life .
5	null	null	Do you believe her excuse ?

11	null	null	Yes , it's fine . However , I personally think the fairways between the greens are a bit too long , especially for such a hot climate . Don't they have carts ?
12	null	null	Well , they used to , but they got rid of them because of environmental concerns .
13	happiness	null	Oh , that's good . I guess the caddies were pleased .
14	null	null	Actually , in my opinion , the carts were better because you don't have to tip them .
15	null	null	Yes , but look at it this way , getting rid of the carts probably gives more work to local people , which is a good thing , right ?
16	null	null	Possibly , but I still miss them ! What bothers me is that the heat makes the caddies ' life quite hard . One member's caddy fainted last week !
17	null	null	How awful , poor guy .
18	null	null	Right . Luckily it was on the eighteen hole , quite near the clubhouse , so he didn't have far to carry him .

4	happiness	null	Well , generally speaking , if you want to change someone ' s mind or understand his position , you have to put yourself in his shoes . Understand his need and the cost for his need . And then you work together to find a solution .
5	null	null	Sounds easy . But how can I apply to practice ? I am thinking about applying for more reimbursement for my mobile bill . But I am afraid our boss will turn me down .

11	null	null	I have plenty of gas .
12	null	null	Yes , but the gas and the battery both have to stay working . We can't just let the car run and run . If we do , it will die soon . Then we'll freeze .
13	null	null	So what can we do ?
14	null	null	Turn the lights off . Then , run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . That will conserve the heat as long as possible .
15	happiness	null	Alright . That's a good idea .

19	null	null	Make it tighter . I want the blood stopped . Then wrap some bandages around the cut . Then we can go . Ouch ! I hope I can walk .

4	happiness	null	Where is it ?
5	happiness	null	It is located at the east foot of Western Mountain of Beijing , in a park with the same name . There are some huge stones within the mountain which look like the censer , so it is called ' Fragrant Mountain ' .
6	happiness	null	Have you visited it before ?
7	happiness	null	Many times . Except climbing , there are many attractions worth visiting .
8	happiness	null	Like what ?
9	happiness	null	It is the best season to view red leaves from the Mid-October to the first ten days of November . During the period , thousands of hectares of maples on the sloping field are so red that you would recognize them as fallen petals by mistake if looking from a further area . The bright red , pink , scarlet , and peach-puff leaves are distributed in different layout , with some green pines and cypresses dotted in between .
10	happiness	null	Sounds marvelous .
11	happiness	null	You can take a bird-eye view at the glorious picture when you arrive at the top of the mountain .
12	happiness	null	Great . I will prepare some clothes and food for the climbing .

2	null	null	Yeah . What's going on ?
3	surprise	null	Not much . What a surprise to see you here .
4	null	null	Yeah . It's been a couple of months since I saw you .
5	null	null	What have you been up to ?
6	null	null	I just started working out .
7	surprise	null	Really ? Where do you work out at ?
8	null	null	I joined the Samsung Health Club last month .
9	null	null	What do you mostly do during your workout ?
10	null	null	I concentrate mostly on my legs , chest , arms and stomach .
11	null	null	I should start exercising more .
12	null	null	It's hard work while exercising , but it is a great feeling when I get done .
13	null	null	I have a running machine at home . I used to use it , but I already got sick of it .
14	null	null	Exercising at home is hard . The environment is not suited for exercising .
15	null	null	If I want to exercise , I will need to join a gym .
16	happiness	null	I have a couple of guest passes . You want to check out my health club ?
17	happiness	null	That's a good idea . Let's go over the weekend .
18	happiness	null	Great . I'll call you Saturday morning .

1	happiness	null	I'm glad we came here . This is really delicious !
2	null	null	I was worried you would think it was too far to drive .
3	null	null	Well , it's true I've never driven two hours just to get lunch . But really , I think it's worth it .
4	null	null	I think if you try some more authentic Chinese food , you might understand how we students from Taiwan suffer .
5	null	null	How do you mean " suffer " ?
6	null	null	I mean , in Milwaukee there is no good Chinese food . So we miss the food in Taiwan too much . Sometimes we just have to drive down here to Chicago to find something better .
7	null	null	Even in the winter ?
8	null	null	Yes , even in the winter .
9	null	null	And even if it takes two hours , huh ?
10	happiness	null	Why not ? I've been craving good food for three weeks now . I'm too sick of hamburgers and pizza !
11	null	null	Well , this really is delicious , I have to admit . I can understand better now why you and your friends are always whining .
12	happiness	null	Don't tease me ! Good food is really important to Chinese !
13	null	null	I know . I can see that . This is what is called " dim sum , " right ?
14	null	null	Yes , all these dishes are different " dim sum " dishes . You can't find this kind of thing except for in a few cities in America .
15	null	null	So when you Chinese think of Chinatown , you mostly think of food . Is that right ?
16	happiness	null	Of course . I will try to buy some things at the Asian grocery down the block too . Then I can do a little cooking in my apartment .
17	null	null	And maybe we can go to a good Italian restaurant for dinner , after the museum . Chicago has some great Italian restaurants .
18	null	null	No way !
19	null	null	What do you mean ?
20	null	null	We're going up to the " new " Chinatown for dinner . I already know where we're going to go .
21	null	null	Alright , alright . I am happy to try more Chinese food . Will it be dim sum again ?
22	null	null	No , dim sum is usually eaten around lunch time , or sometimes closer to breakfast . We ' ll try more Taiwanese style up at the " new " Chinatown .
23	null	null	Taiwanese style ? Isn't dim sum Taiwanese style ?
24	null	null	No , dim sum is more Cantonese style . But of course you can buy it in Taiwan .
25	happiness	null	I wonder if you can cook things this good .
26	happiness	null	I'm a great cook actually . You will see .

2	happiness	null	It was fantastic ! We had such a good time . The only problem was that because it was their high season , we spent hours queuing .
3	happiness	null	Peak periods always entail hours of queuing . At least you got a nice tan though !
4	happiness	null	Yes , Florida had great weather while we were there . You look tan , too . Did you go somewhere ?
5	happiness	null	My friends and I just got back from Bali .
6	happiness	null	Wow ! Bali Islands have some of the best beaches in the world , don't they ?
7	happiness	null	Yes , we were lucky . My friend's father owns a resort on one of the islands , so we were able to stay for free .
8	null	null	Did you go diving while you were there ?
9	null	null	I took a few diving classes , but I didn't really like it , so I did snorkeling instead !
10	null	null	Did you take any pictures in the ocean ?
11	happiness	null	I've got quite a few pictures of all different kinds of fish . I'll show them to you next time I see you .
12	happiness	null	Have you started planning your christmas vacation yet ?
13	happiness	null	We're planning on going skiing in Switzerland . Do you ski ?
14	happiness	null	No , but I do like snowboarding .
15	happiness	null	Would you like to go skiing with us for christmas ?
16	happiness	null	I'll talk to my husband about it ; I'm sure he'll say yes ! He loves Switzerland !

2	happiness	null	Hey , Daddy , today I had really a fantastic history class .
3	surprise	null	Wow , it's so strange for you to say things like that . What had happened ?
4	null	null	We've learnt the story of Zheg He Sailing to West Ocean . He is a real great navigator .
5	null	null	Did your teacher tell you the route he took ?
6	null	null	Yeah , he , with his fleet , came across the Indian Ocean , and arrived at the east coast of Africa .
7	null	null	Great , do you still remember when he started his voyage ?
8	null	null	Of course , that is from 1405 to 1433 , which is in Ming dynasty .
9	null	null	Good , by the way , do you finish reading the book Robinson Crusoe I've bought for you ?
10	null	null	Not yet , you know I have a lot of homework to do .
11	null	null	You should speed up , because the story of Robinson can give you a better understanding about what you learned today .
12	happiness	null	OK , great Daddy , after supper , I'll embark on it .
13	happiness	null	That's my boy ! Wait , Daniel , when is Pirates of the Caribbean on ?
14	happiness	null	Is it about Captain Jack Sparrow , who wants to find the treasure on the sea ?

3	null	null	It would be hard for just me to do it . I don't know the city at all .
4	null	null	So what do you see in there ?
5	null	null	This one sounds good . Efficiency with view of the lake . Utilities and parking included . Newly remodeled kitchen . $ 470 .
6	null	null	Can you afford that much ?
7	null	null	No , I guess not . But that's what I want , isn't it ? An efficiency .
8	null	null	Yes , an efficiency is a small apartment . Usually one large room and a small bathroom . There is often a small kitchen too . So it's good for one person .
9	null	null	How about this one ? Downtown efficiency . Furnished ... What does furnished mean ?
10	null	null	That means the apartment has furniture in it .
11	happiness	null	That's good .
12	null	null	Sometimes it's good , sometimes it's bad . You have to like the furniture .
13	null	null	Furnished . Parking included . $ 400 .
14	null	null	It's still pretty expensive .
15	null	null	Yes , but it's downtown . I would like to take look at this one .
16	null	null	Alright . What's the phone number ?
17	null	null	256-7797 .
18	null	null	Got it . What else do you see ?
19	null	null	This one . Two male grad students seeking roommate . Must be quiet . Comfortable downtown apartment . Does this mean I have to share a room with them ?
20	null	null	No . It probably means they have a large apartment . Probably a living room , kitchen and three bedrooms . They need someone for the empty bedroom .
21	happiness	null	That sounds alright .
22	null	null	Yes , it might be an advantage for you . You are a foreigner , after all . If they're alright roommates , you could learn a lot from them .
23	null	null	Here's the number , 256-4367 .
24	null	null	Got it . Let ' s call these two and see if we can make appointments to see the apartments .

6	null	null	Yes , it was wonderful but it's already been a year . How time flies !
7	happiness	null	Why not go again to celebrate our one-year anniversary ? We can go to the same beach , stay in the same hotel and enjoy a dinner in the same restaurant .

6	happiness	null	This could become a very expensive trip to be beauty parlour !
7	happiness	null	I think it ' s a good idea to pamper yourself occasionally . Don ' t you agree ?
8	null	null	Oh , I agree . We both work hard and a little beauty treatment can relieve stress .
9	null	null	Maybe we should try a thai massage too .
10	null	null	What ' s special about a thai massage ?

7	null	null	I'm sure she knew you loved her . Did she pass away in the hospital ?
8	null	null	Yeah . She died in her sleep .
9	null	null	I'm sorry she's gone .
10	null	null	At least she didn't suffer .
11	null	null	I think your grandmother would want you to think of all the good times you spent together .

The habit does bring kids joy and excitement so long as precautions are taken . Let's go out and set off firecrackers out there .
4	happiness	null	Fantastic ! The whole city is echoing with crackling sounds !
5	null	null	What other activities will you have tomorrow ?
6	null	null	Quite a lot . The celebration of the New Year has just started . The first day we southerners have sweet rice cakes for breakfast , and people in the North have Jiaozi . Afterward , we will make New Year calls on family relatives , husband's side on the first day and wife's side on the second .
7	null	null	Do you bring some gifts along ?
8	null	null	That's for sure . Fruit , cream cakes , medical tonics are often for parents and aged relatives , and cash enclosed in a red envelope for the kids . All this , of course , should be well prepared beforehand .
9	null	null	Is it the same practice for all families ?
10	null	null	Not all the same nowadays I must say . Many families , especially those of newly married couples , choose to make an overseas trip to escape the routines . Rose and I had a tour to Singapore , Malaysia , Thailand and Hong Kong last year . We stayed there for two weeks until the last day of the holiday .
11	null	null	I really appreciate the way you Chinese people exchange feelings . The holiday's long enough for you to relax .
12	null	null	Well , for city dwellers , the Spring Festival is a holiday of seven days . While in the country where traditions are still heavily emphasized , the festival lasts ten days .

4	null	null	I'd like to go to Tianjin .
5	happiness	null	Do you want to go to the beach there ?
6	happiness	null	Yes , of course . And what's your plan ?
7	happiness	null	The same to you .

1	null	null	Do you take a bus to and from work ?
2	null	null	Yeah , everyday . And there ' s only one choice . All the other buses are going the other direction .
3	null	null	Hmm . I have the same problem . When I leave work , it ' s always rush hour . So the buses are always crowded .
4	disgust	null	Oh , yeah , it ' s terrible . I will tell you the funniest thing I have seen in China . It ' s when so many people try to get onto one city bus , and the last guy is squeezed in so tight that the door is tightly pressed against his butt .
5	disgust	null	That sounds terrible the way you describe it . But you know , not long ago I really suffered on the bus .
6	null	null	What happened ? Were you having a hard time getting on a bus ?
7	anger	null	You just can ' t imagine ! I waited for the first bus but it was too full , so I waited for the second , and it was still very crowded . Then I decided not to wait for the next one , and got on the second bus . It was so full that I had to stand on one foot ! No kidding !
8	null	null	Hmm . Good exercise , uh ?
9	null	null	Yeah , absolutely !
10	null	null	And it ' s so much fun . One day , the bodies were so tightly packed that some girl ' s behind was pressed against my front . I was afraid to put my hands down for fear of accidentally groping her .
11	null	null	You were so happy , weren ' t you ?
12	null	null	What do you think ? I ' m a good boy .

2	happiness	null	Yes . Especially in autumn , the red leaves of the maple trees make the whole mountain red .
3	happiness	null	That must be very beautiful .
4	happiness	null	Yes , it can make people feel as if they were in the land of fairies .
5	happiness	null	Really ? Have you ever been there ?
6	happiness	null	A couple of times .

3	happiness	null	Yes , I do . Those are violets , aren ' t they ?
4	happiness	null	Yes , they are . This afternoon , I ' m going to prune the hedge .
5	happiness	null	The lower branches on that tree are hanging very low . Would you like me to cut them off for you ?
6	happiness	null	Thank you ! That would be very kind of you . I have a saw in the garden shed .
7	happiness	null	When the lower branches are removed , you ' ll be able to sit under the tree .

2	happiness	null	Well , in the first year of our marriage , we had great difficulties in getting along . The things that are important to me are not important to him . We had a lot of conflicts .
3	happiness	null	Yeah , I know what you mean . The first year of any marriage is difficult for all couples , not to mention two people from different cultures .
4	happiness	null	Now we have a two-year-old boy . We're very happy that he's healthy and smart .
5	happiness	null	Oh , so he's half Chinese and half American . That's unusual . What languages does he speak , then ?
6	happiness	null	Right now he speaks mostly English , and he can say a few Chinese words . But he will learn in the future .
7	happiness	null	What does he look like ? Can people tell ?
8	happiness	null	Yes , people surely can . He's whiter than the Chinese kids , and his hair is a little blonde . My husband says his eyes are very Chinese though .

4	happiness	null	They're quite popular now . Wasn't her voice good ?
5	null	null	That , My Heart Will Go On . It warms my heart . you know , JanetJackson , Shanna Twain and Celine Dion are so very different .
6	null	null	Janet Jackson is more pop music . Shania sings country music . Celine just seems to hit all the right notes .
7	null	null	Have you heard Maria Carey ?
8	happiness	null	Yes , l have two of her Cds , l'II lend them to you if you like .
9	happiness	null	Excellent . You can borrow my Janet Jackson's CD . It's her new one .

2	happiness	null	In just three weeks , and I am excited . But there are still a few things I need to do before I go .
3	null	null	Like what ?
4	null	null	Like renewing my passport , going to the travel agency to buy my plane ticket and figuring out what to do with my apartment while I'm gone .
5	null	null	You are not going to give it up , are you ?
6	null	null	No way . I'll never find another apartment around here . But I don't like the idea of paying three months ' rent on an empty apartment , either .
7	null	null	I don't blame you . Perhaps you could sublet it .
8	null	null	Yes , but whom to ?
9	happiness	null	Mmm ... let me think . Oh , I know just a person . An old colleague of mine , Jim Thomas , is coming here to do some research this summer , from June to August .
10	happiness	null	That's exactly when I'll be away . It sounds ideal , as long as the landlord agrees .
11	happiness	null	Tell you what , I'll be calling Jim late this week anyway , so I'll mention it to him then .
12	happiness	null	Well , thanks , Bill . Let me know what happens . That extra money will really come in handy .

2	happiness	null	Thanks , June . But I think I need to be certified as a mechanic before I ' m allowed to repair cars for a living .
3	happiness	null	That ' s not a big problem . There are many small schools for adults like you who can study to be certified .
4	happiness	null	I guess I never thought of that before .

1	null	null	Can I help you ?
2	null	null	Yes , I need to buy a computer for this semester . I was told it is cheaper to buy computers here .
3	happiness	null	Well , you heard right . You can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . We have great discounts for students .
4	null	null	I don't know much about computers . But I know I want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . And I need a printer .
5	null	null	Well , first let's consider your computer . Here , for example , is a system I highly recommend--the Power Macintosh G3 . It comes with 64 megabytes of total memory .
6	null	null	Is that a lot ? Sixty-four ?
7	null	null	Yes , it is . It should be enough for any student needs you might have . What department are you in ?
8	null	null	History .
9	null	null	Well , so you will mostly be using word processing , for writing papers . I recommend the Corel Word Perfect program for word processing . We can talk about software later . Let's talk about your
10	null	null	Thirty percent ?
11	null	null	Yes .
12	happiness	null	Wow . That's really good . And you think this is really a good system for a graduate student ?
13	happiness	null	Yes . It's an excellent system .
14	null	null	Hmm . Hey , wait . This has an Apple on it . Is this an Apple computer ?
15	null	null	Yes , it's a Macintosh . It's Apple . Macintosh and Apple are the same thing .
16	null	null	I don't want Macintosh . I want PC .
17	sadness	null	I'm sorry , but our university computer center only sells Macintosh equipment .
18	surprise	null	What ? Are you serious ?
19	null	null	Yes .
20	surprise	null	But nobody uses Macintosh !
21	null	null	That's not true . Most of the students and professors in the university here use Macintosh . They find it is better for writing and word-processing , and that is what students mostly do . Ma
22	null	null	Yes , I'm from Taiwan .
23	null	null	Well , I know that in most Asian countries Apple is not very popular . But here in America , especially in universities and publishing companies , Apple is very commonly used .
24	null	null	But I need a computer that can handle writing in Chinese .
25	null	null	There are several Chinese writing programs you can use with Macintosh . Chinese is no problem for Apple .
26	sadness	null	Hmm . I think I should ask some of my friends for advice before I make a decision . I'm sorry .
27	null	null	No , don't be sorry . It's reasonable to ask your friends . But believe me , most of the students here in the university--Asian students included--most of them use Apple .
28	happiness	null	Well , thanks for your advice . I will probably come back later .

5	null	null	It might be the English teacher . What about you ?

7	happiness	null	She is a pretty good teacher ! With her help I think I can make great progress in English .
8	happiness	null	Yeah , I like her way of teaching . She told us not to cram for exams , and to pay more attention to communicating than memorizing .

9	happiness	null	Very beautiful and very interesting . But why do you hang them in the tree ?
10	null	null	They don't have enough time to peel it after they harvested them , so they hung them in the tree . Then in winter , they can peel corn ears in their leisure time .

2	surprise	null	What ? What did you buy ?
3	anger	null	It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it !
4	null	null	What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ?
5	null	null	There was a guy on the sidewalk . He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes . He said he had to get rid of them quick .
6	null	null	And ?
7	null	null	So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks .
8	null	null	And it's a brick ?
9	null	null	Yes .
10	null	null	I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ?
11	null	null	I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store . If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new .
12	null	null	So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic .
13	null	null	Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products . Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new .
14	null	null	But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ?
15	null	null	He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen .
16	null	null	Aha ! Now I understand . You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk . So , what I think is , you deserve to get cheated !
17	null	null	C'mon , don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it . We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box .
18	null	null	That's no problem . He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy . And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from . Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there . Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around . So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you . Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks .
19	null	null	You're right , Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ?

1	happiness	null	What do you do in your spare time ?
2	happiness	null	I have many hobbies . I like almost all kinds of sports and I also like to listen to classical music .
3	happiness	null	What kinds of sports do you like ?
4	happiness	null	I like playing basketball . Basketball is a very exciting game because it keeps you alert and I also enjoy the team spirit of basketball .
5	happiness	null	Who is your favorite author ?
6	happiness	null	I like the novels of Dickens very much . I've read almost all of them in Chinese translation .
7	happiness	null	Are you a music lover ?
8	happiness	null	Yes , I like listening to Beethoven's works .

5	null	null	Three or four o'clock ?
6	null	null	Yes .
7	null	null	I never stay out that late . That's too late .
8	null	null	But why is it too late ? It's Saturday night . You have nothing to do tomorrow . Why not stay out and drink with us ?
9	null	null	Were you so wild when you were still in Taipei , Sharon ?
10	null	null	Yes , I was . And I like living here . People know how to party here . In Taipei , some people know how to party . But here , everyone does .
11	null	null	What is that they're doing on the couch ?
12	null	null	They're smoking pot . Don't worry about it .
13	surprise	null	Pot ? Isn't that marijuana ?
14	null	null	Yes , it is .
15	surprise	null	But , Sharon , that's illegal ! The police could come , and we could go to jail .
16	null	null	Don't worry about it . It is true that pot is illegal in America . But the laws aren't as strict as in Taiwan . If people are arrested , and they have a little pot in their possession , they don't go to jail . They just have to pay a fine .
17	surprise	null	Really ?
18	null	null	Yes .
19	null	null	I didn't know you had such wild friends . Do you smoke marijuana too ?
20	null	null	I tried it a couple times . But I don't like it . I like alcohol better . Don ' t worry about them , though . If you don't want to smoke pot , you don't have to .
21	null	null	I don't want to .
22	null	null	That's alright . But you really should have another drink . People will probably start dancing soon .
23	null	null	I don't know if I can drink more . I already had two drinks .
24	null	null	You had two drinks at nine o'clock . C'mon , Ann , you are in an American university now ! You have to learn how to drink .
25	null	null	I thought a university was for studying .
26	null	null	It is . We study hard all week . And then , on the weekend , we party hard . That's the best way to live .
27	null	null	Alright . I'll have another drink .

2	happiness	null	I didn't know about it . What did you do ?
3	happiness	null	We ate a lot of things . We played games and gave gifts to Jessie . We had a lot of fun .
4	happiness	null	You were really lucky .
5	happiness	null	My birthday comes next month . I want to hold a birthday party , too .

1	happiness	null	It ' s so relaxing , taking a walk in the country . The air is so fresh and clean .
2	null	null	would you like to live in the country ? I ' m not sure I ' d like it .
3	null	null	I can see a lot of advantage and disadvantage . The problem is that , for me , each advantage has its own disadvantage .
4	null	null	What do you mean ?
5	disgust	null	Well , I hate the noise in the city , but I love being around lost of people . The problem is that you can ' t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . The two just don ' t go together .
6	null	null	I see what you mean . I love being far away from a city , but I hate being so far away department stores and sports facilities .
7	null	null	People can ' t have it both ways . If you live in the country , it is often less convenient . If you live in a city , it is noisy , but there ' s more to do .
8	happiness	null	I would love to be surrounded by hills and streams . They ' re so much better to look at than concrete , rows of parked cars and tall buildings .
9	happiness	null	I would love to hear the birds singing and feel the fresh breeze on my face . When the wind blows in the city , you get dust in your mouth and in your eyes .
10	happiness	null	The view from the hill is so beautiful and relaxing . There ' s so sign of pollution . The village looks so peaceful .
11	null	null	Just remember that in that village there ' s nothing to do . There ' s not even a pub or restaurant . There ' s just one small shop with a poor selection of goods .
12	disgust	null	You ' re right . I would have to travel to the city at least once a week to go shopping and see friends . I would hate living in the country !

4	happiness	null	yes , I adore simple fashions . How does it look on me ?
5	happiness	null	it looks great , but you need something to go with it . It's too plain on its own .
6	happiness	null	how about this blue sweater ?
7	happiness	null	that's a good idea . When did you buy it ? Is it a name brand ?
8	happiness	null	yes , but I bought it when it was on sale , 50 % off the original price . OK , what do you think ?
9	happiness	null	that looks lovely . Just one more thing---you need a pair of earrings .
10	happiness	null	I've got a pair of pearl earrings . Here it is .

4	anger	null	It was a few things . The first thing that happened was that we were supposed to go out for a romantic dinner for our one year anniversary , but she stood me up !
5	surprise	null	Really ! Did she tell you why she didn't show up ?
6	anger	null	No , but I ended up finding out later that night when I saw her drinking with another man at a club near my home !
7	null	null	What was she thinking ? Did you confront her about it when you saw her ?
8	anger	null	I wanted to , but I knew that if I spoke to her , I'd just blow up at her , so I decided to just go home . I called her later that the night , but she didn't answer the phone .
9	null	null	I can't believe she would do that to you . It's so dishonest-and rude !
10	anger	null	I know . I still haven't heard from her . The good thing is that I'm so angry with her that I don't feel sad about not having her around .
11	null	null	I bet you that she regrets what she's done . You are such a good catch ! She really lost out , didn't she ?

4	null	null	Well , Qi is famous all over the world , isn ' t he ? Besides I am quite interested in Chinese painting .
5	happiness	null	Cool ! What kind of Chinese painting do you prefer , free sketch or claborate-style painting ?
6	null	null	I prefer free sketch , especially the landscape paintings . I can always feel peace and harmony from those landscape paintings .
7	null	null	That's true . Chinese art stresses the harmony between man and nature , which is an important part of China's traditional culture .

4	happiness	null	Yeah , and most importantly , she's single ! Man , I could tell from the moment I saw her , she's the girl of my dreams !
5	null	null	So I take it you two are hitting it off ? I know it's very convenient to be in a relationship with your neighbor , but what if you break up ?
6	null	null	I don't know . I am not really worried about that . I don't wanna lose before even starting . Besides I think the other two American guys have also fallen for her .
7	null	null	Sounds like you've got some competition . You made a move already ?
8	null	null	Not yet . But I am thinking of inviting her to dinner sometime . I know some good restaurants nearby .
9	null	null	That's nice . Having been here a little while surely gives you the advantage , eh ?

3	happiness	null	I love it ! I used to always want to drive a green jaguar . Is it in good condition ?
4	null	null	it looks good on the outside , but the inside is a different story . It needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again .
5	null	null	what's wrong with it ?
6	null	null	well , first of all , it needs a new engine , which is extremely expensive .
7	null	null	when's the last time you had it serviced ?
8	null	null	it must have been a few years ago now .
9	null	null	I thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis .
10	null	null	they do . Once my son was born , there was no reason to drive this car anymore . It's only a two-seater , you know !
11	null	null	what else is wrong with it ?
12	null	null	the heating controls don't work anymore , so it always feels like it's about 100 degrees in the car -- even in the summer !
13	null	null	anything else ?
14	null	null	the brakes don't really work that well anymore either .
15	null	null	why don't you get it all fixed ?
16	null	null	it costs more than you think to run a car , especially when there are so many things wrong with it !

9	surprise	null	Relly ? That's amazing .
10	null	null	Yes , it really is . After having vegetarian diet . I have much more energy , I need less sleep , I feel calmer . I can maintain an ideal body weight without worrying about how much I eat and I can think more clearly .

12	null	null	Yes , maybe . But I feel better since becoming a vegetarian . Maybe you could also have a try .

8	happiness	null	The same to me . All the things here make me happy , the mountain , the water , the grass , the birds , the sunshine ...

1	happiness	null	London is such a historical city ! There ' s history everywhere you look . There ' s nelson ' s column , built as a monument to one of the Britain ' s great admirals and his important victory . He won the battle of Trafalgar in 1805 .
2	happiness	null	I ' m looking forward to seeing Westminster abbey , where many historical figures are buried , like Isaac Newton , the great mathematician and Winston Churchill , the great wartime leader .
3	happiness	null	Nearby , on the banks of the thames , there ' s the statue of Boadicea . She fought the Romans when they invaded Britain .
4	happiness	null	Women have often played an important role in British history . Queen Elizabeth I built a navy strong enough to fight off the Spanish armada in 1588 . more recently , Margaret thatcher transformed british society in the 1980 ' s .
5	happiness	null	She was a very controversial leader . Are we going to visit the famous tower of London later ?
6	happiness	null	There ' s a lot to see there . Perhaps we should go tomorrow .
7	happiness	null	I ' m looking forward to seeing the famous castle and prison . Many historic figures were imprisoned there in the past . I really want to see the crown jewels too .
8	happiness	null	I ' Ve seen them before . They ' re quite incredible . If you want to see historical figures in London , there ' s one place you have to go .
9	happiness	null	Where ' s that ? Oh , I know ! Madame Tussaud ' s the waxworks museum .
10	happiness	null	There you can see british leaders , entertainers , criminals , and royalty .
11	happiness	null	Sometimes , it ' s hard to know who belongs in each section of the museum !

5	null	null	What do you think about the teachers ?
6	null	null	To be honest , I liked all of them , except for the math teacher . Though he must be quite young , he seem like an old person . He ' s so boring !
7	null	null	That ' s too bad . How was your English teacher ?
8	null	null	She was great . In today ' s class , she gave us a lecture on how to be a good student . She told us not to arm for exams , and to pay more attention on communicating than memorizing .
9	null	null	Where is she from ?
10	null	null	She said that she ' s from a small town in the middle of America .
11	null	null	Were you able to understand everything that she said ?
12	null	null	Not everything , but nearly . She speaks very clearly and doesn ' t use very complex words so that it is easy for us to understand her .
13	null	null	She sounds like a good teacher . Do you think you ' ll pass her class ?
14	happiness	null	Yes ... with flying colors !
15	null	null	What does that mean ?
16	happiness	null	It ' s a new phrase that she taught us today . It means that I will not only pass the class , but I will do extremely well !
17	null	null	If you like the class this much already , I ' m sure you will .
18	null	null	I hope so .
19	null	null	did she give you any homework ?

4	null	null	Yeah . Earthquake is one of the most badly natural disasters in the world .
5	null	null	That's why many people died in the earthquake .
6	null	null	Well , China is located on the Eurasia plate , where earthquakes happen frequently due to the earth's plates knocking against each other .
7	null	null	Oh , China does have been plagued by numerous destructive earthquakes during its long history .
8	null	null	Yeah , we've experienced the 8 . 0 magnitude earthquake in Wenchman .
9	null	null	We're all familiar with natural disasters . but we still feel weak when we face Wenchman earthquake .
10	happiness	null	Right . But people at that time only know two words , " save " and " assistance " , they will never don't lift a finger . Life is the most important compared with anything else .

5	null	null	it wasn't just once . Every single time I take the bus , something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus .
6	null	null	we could take the subway , but we'd have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice .
7	null	null	train fares are twice as expensive as the bus fare , too .

5	happiness	null	I think the Olympics help to promote world peace .
6	null	null	I ' m not sure about that . We still have many wars in the world . I think that the idea behind the Olympics is a good one , but the reality is that during the Olympics countries compete . There ' s no real spirit of cooperation and people are usually not very friendly to each other .
7	null	null	You are so pessimistic ! The Olympics is a great opportunity for athletes to demonstrate their speed , skill , agility and strength . Most people hope to see someone from their country win , but I think that they are just happy to see good performances by any athlete .

4	null	null	Well sir , our sales have dropped , no plunged , fifty percent in the past month alone . We are currently overstocked and overstaffed and our profits refalling fast . The market is in recession and we have no way of moving our inventory , or getting rid of our staff . If we consider redundancies , it would cost us a fortune because of the new regulations governing compensation packages . It ' s a real mess .

7	surprise	null	What ! Geez ! How could this have happened ? So what ' s the bad news ?
8	null	null	Oh , that ' s the really bad news . Our supplier suffered QC problems and , well , half of our production is faulty . We ' re going to have to recall all itemssold in the last quarter . And the worst part ? We ' re going to have to shoulder this cost .
9	surprise	null	Are you joking ? Get the supplier on the line now ! They have to assume the costs of this mess !

1	sadness	null	I don't know what I'm going to do . I need to find a job . If I don't , I won't be able to stay here next semester .
2	null	null	Have you tried university part-time jobs ?
3	null	null	What do you mean ?
4	null	null	I mean in the library , or in some information center . Often the university hires foreign students for part-time positions .
5	null	null	Yes , I know . I tried that . They don't have anything now . So what can I do ?
6	null	null	Well , since you're a foreign student , it's hard . That ' s because it's actually illegal for you to work in America .
7	sadness	null	I know that . You don't have to tell me that . That's my problem . I know I have the right to work for the university . That's legal . But they don't have a job for me . And it's illegal for me to get a job elsewhere .
8	null	null	Anyway , there must be some solution . You know there are many people working illegally in New York .
9	null	null	But I need a pretty decent job . I need to make enough to pay my rent at least .
10	null	null	I have an idea .
11	null	null	What ?
12	null	null	Since you're Chinese , maybe you can find part-time work in Chinatown .
13	sadness	null	I already had that idea .
14	null	null	Well , why don't you go and look down there ?
15	null	null	But I don't know what I would do .
16	null	null	It may be part-time work as a waitress or something . It would be illegal , but sometimes waitresses make a good salary .
17	null	null	Maybe . I don't know .
18	null	null	I will ask my friends for you . Maybe someone knows a company that needs part-time people . That ' s another thing you should do . Ask all your friends to ask around for you . You might find something .
19	sadness	null	I have to find something . Otherwise I have to go back to Taiwan . I'll be broke in two months .

6	happiness	null	Wow , that's really old .
7	happiness	null	Yes , I like collecting antiques .
8	null	null	Why don't you get a new one ?
9	null	null	I don't know . I like this one , and I don't have any need for all the bells and whistles you get on the new ones .
10	surprise	null	Really , what makes you say that ?
11	null	null	Well , I just need to make and receive calls , and it's quite reliable . I find that the more fancy stuff they put into these things , the more likely they are to break bown or go wrong , you know ? I mean , this camera function , for instance-how often do you use it ?
12	null	null	Sometimes , but I guess not very often . It's more for fun . Sometimes when I'm on a trip , for example , I can take a picture and send it to my kids . Or I can send a picture of a sample back to my office and get it costed up immediately .
13	happiness	null	Well , that's nice I guess . So how many kids do you have ?
14	happiness	null	Three . Two boys and a girl .

1	null	null	What's wrong ?
2	anger	null	I have a headache . These past few days I've been living off painkillers . Man , I feel like my head is going to explode .
3	null	null	You should get acupuncture treatment . My mom was always having headache issues and it was acupuncture that cured her .
4	null	null	The results are too slow . On top of that , just the thought of smoking needles poking into my flesh frightens me .
5	null	null	They don't just randomly stick you , they find your pressure points . The heat allows the body to immediately respond to the treatment , restoring the body's " chi " .
6	fear	null	But I get scared the moment I see a needle . How could I stand having needles in my body for hours on end ?
7	null	null	The needles are very thin , and as long as the doctor's technique is good , and the patient himself is relaxed , it won't hurt-on the contrary it will actually alleviate pain . Now there are high-tech needles that are micro thin ; they don't hurt at all . However , if you are really scared of acupuncture , scraping or cupping are also options .
8	fear	null	Scraping is too terrifying . When they finish scrapping , your body is all red , as if you were just tortured . Cupping is the same , your body ends up with red circles all over . It looks like someone beat you up .
9	null	null	This only signifies that the toxins have left the body . Actually , there is only discomfort during the treatment process . Once it's over you feel very comfortable .
10	null	null	Chinese medicine is strange . The patients are already ill , and then the doctor makes them suffer more .
11	null	null	This is the only way to get at the problem . Anyway , if you want to relieve the pain , you are just going to have to be tough and do it .
12	null	null	Forget it . I don't want to inflict any more pain on myself . In a little while I'll go and buy some more painkillers and take a nap .

4	null	null	If I were you , I would change the beginning . You should write about your education first because we like to judge a man by his abilities .
5	happiness	null	Good idea , Betty . What would you think about the second part ?
6	null	null	I think it's too short . You'd better say something about your work experience .

4	happiness	null	Ok , for starters we have Tom Yam soup . It's a bit spicy , but really good !
5	happiness	null	This is delicious ! The ginger and lemongrass really gives it a nice taste !
6	happiness	null	Now this next dish is one of the most famous . Foreigners call it papaya salad but the proper name is Tom Sam . It is a spicy salad made from a mix of fresh vegetables including shredded unripened papaya and tomato .
7	happiness	null	This is delicious ! The combination of sour and spicy is really interesting ! I could have this everyday !
8	happiness	null	Ok , now for the last and best dish in my opinion . This is called Pad Thai . It's stir-fried noodles with eggs , fish sauce , tamarind juice , red chili pepper plus bean sprouts , shrimp and tofu and garnished with crushed peanuts and coriander . It's practically Thailand's national dish !

15	null	null	Do you know what she is doing now ?
16	null	null	As a matter of fact , I do . After she taught our class , she got married and moved to another city . Then , she started writing children ' s book .

1	surprise	null	I can ' t believe my English teacher is making me read pride and prejudice !
2	null	null	Why not ! It ' s a classic . In fact , it ' s one of my favorite novels .
3	null	null	But it ' s so old .
4	null	null	Don ' t judge a book by its cover . Do you know what it ' s about ?
5	null	null	No , not at all .
6	null	null	First of all , it ' s a romance novel , set in the early 19th century .
7	null	null	I didn ' t realize it was a romance novel . What ' s the main storyline ?
8	null	null	It ' s basically about a father who tried to marry off one of his five girls .
9	null	null	Why does he want to do that ?
10	null	null	Since he doesn ' t have a son , he hopes that one of the girls will marry a wealthy man . That way , all of his daughters will be cared for .
11	null	null	Won ' t they get his inheritance ?
12	null	null	No , that ' s the problem . Though they are well-off , once he dies , his house will go to his cousin . So , when he dies , the girls will have nothing .
13	happiness	null	I see . This sounds interesting ! Maybe my teacher isn ' t so horrible after all .
14	null	null	So , are you going to read the novel or watch the movie ?
15	surprise	null	There ' s movie ? My teacher didn ' t tell me that !
16	null	null	That ' s probably because she wants you to read the book first .
17	null	null	It would take a lot less time ...
18	null	null	How about this . When you finish the book . I ' ll get the movie and watch it with you .
19	happiness	null	Ok . That sounds like a deal .

1	anger	null	Stephanie ! Did you just get to school ? But you were up and about when I left the dorm this morning ! That was about an hour and a half ago . This happens all the time ! Why do you always take so long to get ready the morning ?
2	null	null	It ' s a skill . What can I say ? I don ' t know why , I just have a long routine .
3	anger	null	Please explain because it makes no sense to me . How can a girl ' s routine be so complicated ? You get up , you shower , you get dressed , you brush your teeth , you ' re out the door . Half an hour , tops .
4	anger	null	Jacob , you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling . I don ' t . I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings . Every day , I wake up and head straight for the shower . Every second day , I wash my hair . If it ' s a hair-washing day , I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily . Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too . Because my hair is so long , I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes . Afterwards , I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew . I take a long time to get dressed in the morning . Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before , but usually I do it in the morning . In all , getting dressed takes about half an hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair . From time to time I ' ll put my hair up , but oftentimes I bloody it straight . And then , because of the texture of my hair , I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing . That ' s another twenty minutes or so . After that , I have my daily makeup routine .
5	null	null	True , I hardly ever see you without your hair done and your makeup on , even when you show up to class in sweatpants . Tell me , how long does it take you to choose that outfit in the morning ?

1	null	null	Han Maimed , What's your plan for the weekend ?
2	null	null	I plan to travel around Harvard University and know more about it . To tell you the truth , I plan to apply for Harvard after graduation from high school . It ' s better to get to know it . What about you ?
3	null	null	I get together with my Christian brothers on Saturdays .
4	surprise	null	Oh , my God ! John , I didn ' t know you are religious . You just look like a scientific kook , like Leonard in the Big Bang Theory .
5	null	null	Come on , Han Maimed , don ' t make a fuss . A lot of Americans , including many scientists , believe in religion .
6	null	null	But I ' m really surprised . I thought science and religion are not compatible , are they ?
7	null	null	Yes , they are compatible . Actually , the U . S . is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world .
8	null	null	I've heard about it a little bit before , but I don ' t understand . How can people believe in God since they know God doesn't exist ?
9	null	null	That ' s a little complicated . You ' ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U . S . history later on . Religion was and is a part of American people ' s life . Guess what ? Even Harvard University , which is a highly academic institution , is in a sense the product of religion .
10	surprise	null	Really ?
11	null	null	Absolutely ! It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England .
12	null	null	Why was it founded by the Puritans ? Where were the atheistic educators ?
13	null	null	Because most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans .
14	surprise	null	How come ? I mean why most of them were religious people ?
15	null	null	That ' s because in the 16th and 17th century , there was a series of religious reforms in England . Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries .
16	null	null	So , you mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England ?
17	null	null	Yes , that's why Puritans moved to the New World , where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans . Later on , it was these Puritans who founded Harvard College .
18	null	null	Why did they want to found a college ?
19	null	null	Many Puritans had received classic style of higher education in Oxford University and Cambridge University back in England . They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well .
20	null	null	Oh , I see .
21	null	null	Actually Harvard was first named ' New College ' , without a formal name .
22	null	null	When did it begin to be called Harvard University ?
23	null	null	In 1639 , it was renamed after its major benefactor John Harvard . Interestingly , JohnHarvard himself was a clergyman .
24	null	null	It seems that Harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion .
25	null	null	Therefore , it ' s not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion , there would note Harvard .
26	null	null	Wow , I didn ' t know that religion had played such an important role in Harvard history .
27	null	null	Religion has been playing an indispensible part in Harvard history as well as the U . S .
28	null	null	I finally begin to get to know Harvard . It seems that my knowledge of Harvard is rather poor . I have a lot work to do before applying for Harvard .
29	null	null	Remember that Harvard is a part of the United States . So you have to know the U . S . history and culture if you want to have in-depth knowledge of Harvard . The two are closely related .
30	happiness	null	That ' s right . I have a lot to learn from you .
31	happiness	null	You can ask me any question at any time .

3	happiness	null	Never mind . What about taking a look around the theater ?
4	happiness	null	Why not ? I'd love to do that .
5	null	null	Here we go . There is a museum of the Beijing Opera art .
6	happiness	null	Wow . Look at this . So delicate and beautiful . Did ancient Chinese people really wear them ?
7	null	null	Not really . They are just opera costumes . Do you like the embroidery ?
8	null	null	I surely do . They must have had advanced machines in ancient China to do that .
9	null	null	No , no , no . They are all handmade , girl . You know , the ancient Chinese women were supposed to be good at needlework .
10	surprise	null	Unbelievable ! I could never do that .
11	null	null	Very few can . That's why these clothes only appear in the museum .
12	happiness	null	Listen ! Some people are singing outside . Is it the opera ?
13	happiness	null	Oh , yes . I heard there was an opera fans club . They are probably practicing now . Wanna have a look ?
14	happiness	null	Yes , let's do it .

4	happiness	null	I was trembling in the wind when he ran to me with an umbrella in his hand and asked , ' Where is your home ? '

4	sadness	null	I have done a lot of reading comprehension exercises , and I also spend much time in memorizing English words .
5	null	null	I suggest you read English texts aloud every day , and try to speak more . That will be beneficial to cultivate your sense of the language .

3	null	null	Well , I hope they're paying you the big bucks for all this work ...
4	null	null	No , not exactly , I'm working for minimum wage . And they don't give extra pay for overtime . Overtime is our own time .
5	surprise	null	What ? ! Isn't there a law against that , I think there is some legislation that requires employers to give their employees a fair rate of wages . You should know your rights ! If you are putting in so many hours , they should give you some kind of compensation .
6	null	null	They do give bonuses at the end of the year for the employees with highest productivity numbers , but frankly , it's not much of an incentive . They give us a bonus of ten dollars .
7	anger	null	That's just wrong ! why don't you just quit ?
8	null	null	I would , but I'm afraid I would't be able to find another job . I don't have very many job marketable skills , there aren't so many jobs that I'm qualified for .
